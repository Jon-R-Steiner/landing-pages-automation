# Story 1.2.1: Identify Phase 1 Context Files

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Phase 0 developer,
**I want** a documented list of context files Phase 1 must load,
**so that** session configuration references all necessary files for autonomous Phase 1 execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Context files list documented in `docs/phase-1-context-files.md`
2. List includes: `docs/architecture.md` (exists from Phase 0), `docs/prd.md` (this document), `docs/mcp-integration-patterns.md` (Story 1.6), `.bmad-core/templates/living-doc-tmpl.yaml` (Story 1.2), `.bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml`
3. For each context file, document: purpose (why dev-agent needs it), loading priority (always load vs. load on demand), approximate token cost
4. Include living documentation files dev-agent will create following two-tier strategy (Active tier files only for initial load)
5. Explicitly mark files as "must exist before Phase 1" vs. "dev-agent will create" with expected structure notes
6. Context files list committed to Git with message: `docs: define Phase 1 context file loading strategy`

  - [ ] Verify commit was created successfully

## Dev Notes

### Context
First story in Phase 0 Epic 2 (Session Configuration & Phase 1 Preparation). Defines complete context loading strategy for dev-agent autonomous Phase 1 execution.

### Key Information
- **Document Location:** `docs/phase-1-context-files.md`
- **Required Existing Files:**
  - `docs/architecture.md` (system architecture)
  - `docs/prd.md` (product requirements)
  - `docs/mcp-integration-patterns.md` (Story 1.6 output)
  - `.bmad-core/templates/living-doc-tmpl.yaml` (Story 1.2 output)
  - `.bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml` (technical config)

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Story 1.6 (requires MCP integration patterns)
- **Blocks:** Story 2.3 (session configuration needs this list)
- **Informs:** Dev-agent Phase 1 initialization

### Context Loading Strategy
- **Always Load:** Architecture, PRD, MCP patterns (critical for all stages)
- **Load on Demand:** Templates, preferences (reference when needed)
- **Two-Tier Living Docs:** Active tier (current + last 3) loaded initially, Archive tier on keyword

### File Purpose Summary
- **architecture.md:** Technical design, component specs, API definitions
- **prd.md:** Requirements, success criteria, user stories
- **mcp-integration-patterns.md:** Third-party integration guide
- **living-doc-tmpl.yaml:** Documentation structure template
- **technical-preferences.yaml:** Tech stack, conventions, standards

### Important Decisions
- Context list is dev-agent's "loading manifest"
- Token costs inform loading priority decisions
- Two-tier strategy reduces initial context load
- Files categorized by existence (pre-existing vs. agent-created)
- Loading strategy optimizes for Phase 1 autonomous execution

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required (documentation artifact)
- File existence verification (must-exist files)
- Token cost calculation validation

**Validation Requirements:**
- All required files listed
- Purposes clearly documented
- Loading priorities defined
- Token costs estimated
- Living docs strategy applied
- File existence tagged correctly
- Document committed to Git
