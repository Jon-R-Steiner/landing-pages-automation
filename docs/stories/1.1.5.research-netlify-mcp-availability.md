# Story 1.1.5: Research Netlify MCP Availability

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** Integration Specialist agent (future),
**I want** detailed research on Netlify MCP capabilities,
**so that** I can integrate Netlify deployments with documented patterns or HTTP fallbacks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tavily MCP used to search for Netlify MCP information (API, GitHub repos, documentation)
2. Research document created at `docs/mcp-research/netlify-mcp.md` with findings
3. Document includes: MCP existence determination (exists/doesn't exist/unstable), API coverage assessment (deployment, site management, build hooks), authentication patterns
4. If MCP exists: Document installation instructions, basic usage patterns, agent integration examples
5. If MCP doesn't exist: Document HTTP/REST fallback strategy with example API calls for Netlify CLI alternative commands
6. Research completed within 2-4 hours (NFR3 requirement), findings committed to Git with message: `docs: research Netlify MCP integration options`

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Document search results and sources
- [ ] Analyze MCP existence (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Review search results for MCP availability
  - [ ] Determine status: exists/doesn't exist/unstable
  - [ ] Document evidence for determination
  - [ ] Note any version or maintenance issues
- [ ] Assess API coverage if MCP exists (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Identify available Netlify operations via MCP:
    - Site deployment
    - Build hooks
    - Site management
    - Environment variables
  - [ ] Document authentication mechanisms
  - [ ] Note any limitations or gaps
  - [ ] Gather installation instructions
  - [ ] Find usage examples for agents
- [ ] Document HTTP/REST fallback if no MCP (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Research Netlify REST API documentation
  - [ ] Document authentication requirements (API tokens)
  - [ ] Provide example API calls for common operations:
    - Deploy site
    - Trigger build hook
    - Update environment variables
    - Check deployment status
  - [ ] Document Netlify CLI alternative commands
  - [ ] Document rate limits and constraints
- [ ] Create research document (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `docs/mcp-research/netlify-mcp.md`
  - [ ] Document MCP existence determination
  - [ ] Include API coverage assessment
  - [ ] Document authentication patterns
  - [ ] Add installation instructions (if MCP exists)
  - [ ] Add HTTP/REST fallback (if no MCP)
  - [ ] Include Netlify CLI alternatives
  - [ ] Include integration examples
- [ ] Verify time constraint (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Track research time
  - [ ] Ensure completion within 2-4 hours
  - [ ] Document time spent in validation log
- [ ] Commit research to Git (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Review document for completeness
  - [ ] Stage file with `git add`
  - [ ] Create commit with message: `docs: research Netlify MCP integration options`
  - [ ] Verify commit was created successfully

## Dev Notes

### Context
Seventh story in Phase 0 Epic 1. Second of three MCP research stories. This research enables Phase 1 agents to integrate with Netlify for deployment automation and site management.

### Key Information
- **Research Location:** `docs/mcp-research/netlify-mcp.md`
- **Research Tool:** Tavily MCP (installed in Story 1.0)
- **Time Constraint:** 2-4 hours (NFR3 requirement)
- **Integration Context:** Netlify is used for:
  - Serverless Functions (submit-form, validate-recaptcha, webhook-make-com)
  - Site deployment and hosting
  - Build hooks triggered by Make.com
  - Environment variable management

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Story 1.0 (requires Tavily MCP)
- **Blocks:** Story 1.6 (MCP integration patterns document)
- **Informs:** Phase 1 Stage 6 (Deployment & Testing implementation)

### Netlify Integration Requirements
From architecture, Netlify is used for:
- Serverless Functions deployment
- Production site hosting
- Automated deployments via webhooks
- Environment configuration management

### Research Focus Areas
1. **MCP Availability:** Does official or community MCP exist?
2. **Authentication:** API token management
3. **Key Operations:** Site deployment, build hooks, environment vars, function deployment
4. **CLI Alternative:** Netlify CLI commands if no MCP/HTTP available
5. **Fallback Strategy:** HTTP/REST API if no MCP available

### Important Decisions
- Tavily MCP enables comprehensive web research
- Research must be actionable for Phase 1 agents
- CLI alternative provides additional deployment option
- HTTP/REST fallback ensures integration possible even without MCP
- Time constraint focuses research on essential information

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required (research activity)
- Tavily MCP functional test (search returns results)
- Document completeness review

**Validation Requirements:**
- Tavily MCP searches executed successfully
- Research document created and complete
- MCP existence clearly determined
- Integration approach documented (MCP, HTTP, or CLI)
- Research completed within 2-4 hours
- Document committed to Git
