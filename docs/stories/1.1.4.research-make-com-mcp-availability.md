# Story 1.1.4: Research Make.com MCP Availability

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** Integration Specialist agent (future),
**I want** detailed research on Make.com MCP capabilities,
**so that** I can integrate Make.com workflows with documented patterns or HTTP fallbacks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tavily MCP used to search for Make.com MCP information (API, GitHub repos, documentation)
2. Research document created at `docs/mcp-research/make-com-mcp.md` with findings
3. Document includes: MCP existence determination (exists/doesn't exist/unstable), API coverage assessment, authentication patterns
4. If MCP exists: Document installation instructions, basic usage patterns, agent integration examples
5. If MCP doesn't exist: Document HTTP/REST fallback strategy with example API calls for common Make.com operations
6. Research completed within 2-4 hours (NFR3 requirement), findings committed to Git with message: `docs: research Make.com MCP integration options`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Conduct Tavily MCP searches (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Search for "Make.com MCP server"
  - [ ] Search for "Make.com Model Context Protocol"
  - [ ] Search for "Make.com API integration Claude"
  - [ ] Search GitHub for Make.com MCP repositories
  - [ ] Document search results and sources
- [ ] Analyze MCP existence (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Review search results for MCP availability
  - [ ] Determine status: exists/doesn't exist/unstable
  - [ ] Document evidence for determination
  - [ ] Note any version or maintenance issues
- [ ] Assess API coverage if MCP exists (AC: 3, 4)
  - [ ] Identify available Make.com operations via MCP
  - [ ] Document authentication mechanisms
  - [ ] Note any limitations or gaps
  - [ ] Gather installation instructions
  - [ ] Find usage examples for agents
- [ ] Document HTTP/REST fallback if no MCP (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Research Make.com REST API documentation
  - [ ] Document authentication requirements (API keys, OAuth)
  - [ ] Provide example API calls for common operations:
    - Create scenario
    - Trigger scenario execution
    - Check scenario status
    - Retrieve scenario results
  - [ ] Document rate limits and constraints
- [ ] Create research document (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `docs/mcp-research/make-com-mcp.md`
  - [ ] Document MCP existence determination
  - [ ] Include API coverage assessment
  - [ ] Document authentication patterns
  - [ ] Add installation instructions (if MCP exists)
  - [ ] Add HTTP/REST fallback (if no MCP)
  - [ ] Include integration examples
- [ ] Verify time constraint (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Track research time
  - [ ] Ensure completion within 2-4 hours
  - [ ] Document time spent in validation log
- [ ] Commit research to Git (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Review document for completeness
  - [ ] Stage file with `git add`
  - [ ] Create commit with message: `docs: research Make.com MCP integration options`
  - [ ] Verify commit was created successfully

## Dev Notes

### Context
Sixth story in Phase 0 Epic 1. First of three MCP research stories. This research enables Phase 1 agents to integrate with Make.com workflows for content generation and deployment automation.

### Key Information
- **Research Location:** `docs/mcp-research/make-com-mcp.md`
- **Research Tool:** Tavily MCP (installed in Story 1.0)
- **Time Constraint:** 2-4 hours (NFR3 requirement)
- **Integration Context:** Make.com Scenarios:
  1. Content generation (Claude API → PMax assets)
  2. Deployment trigger (webhook → Netlify build)

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Story 1.0 (requires Tavily MCP)
- **Blocks:** Story 1.6 (MCP integration patterns document)
- **Informs:** Phase 1 Stage 5 (Make.com automation implementation)

### Make.com Integration Requirements
From architecture, Make.com is used for:
- Content generation via Claude API
- Performance Max asset creation
- Netlify deployment webhooks
- Automated workflow orchestration

### Research Focus Areas
1. **MCP Availability:** Does official or community MCP exist?
2. **Authentication:** API key management, OAuth requirements
3. **Key Operations:** Scenario creation, execution, status checking
4. **Fallback Strategy:** HTTP/REST API if no MCP available

### Important Decisions
- Tavily MCP enables comprehensive web research
- Research must be actionable for Phase 1 agents
- HTTP/REST fallback ensures integration possible even without MCP
- Time constraint focuses research on essential information

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required (research activity)
- Tavily MCP functional test (search returns results)
- Document completeness review

**Validation Requirements:**
- Tavily MCP searches executed successfully
- Research document created and complete
- MCP existence clearly determined
- Integration approach documented (MCP or HTTP)
- Research completed within 2-4 hours
- Document committed to Git
