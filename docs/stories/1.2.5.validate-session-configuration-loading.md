# Story 1.2.5: Validate Session Configuration Loading

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Phase 0 developer,
**I want** to test that session configuration loads without errors in Claude Code,
**so that** Phase 1 can start autonomously without configuration failures blocking progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Attempt to load `claude-session-config.yaml` in Claude Code environment (manual test or via script if validator available)
2. YAML parsing successful: no syntax errors, all required sections present (context_files, credentials, checkpoint_triggers, success_criteria, workflow_reference)
3. Context file paths validated: all referenced files either exist or are documented as "Phase 1 will create"
4. Environment variable references validated: placeholders follow correct syntax `${VAR_NAME}`, no hardcoded secrets present (security scan confirms)
5. Checkpoint trigger logic validated: time intervals reasonable (30min not 30sec), error handling appropriate
6. If loading fails: document specific errors in `docs/phase-0-validation-log.md`, fix configuration, re-test until successful load
7. Successful configuration loading documented in validation log with timestamp and any warnings/notes
8. Add negative test cases: Test with missing environment variable (expect graceful error), Test with malformed YAML (expect parse error with line number), Test with invalid file path (expect clear file-not-found error)

## Dev Notes

### Context
Fifth story in Phase 0 Epic 2. Validates that session configuration from Stories 2.3 and 2.4 loads correctly in Claude Code environment. This is the final validation before Phase 1 handoff.

### Key Information
- **Config Location:** `Landing Pages Automation/claude-session-config.yaml`
- **Validation Log:** `docs/phase-0-validation-log.md` (append results)
- **Validation Types:**
  1. YAML syntax validation
  2. Structure completeness validation
  3. File path validation
  4. Environment variable validation
  5. Logic validation
  6. Negative testing (error handling)

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Stories 2.3 (session config), 2.4 (success criteria)
- **Blocks:** Story 2.6 (Phase 0 completion validation)
- **Informs:** Phase 1 readiness assessment

### Validation Approach
- **Positive Tests:** Configuration loads successfully with valid inputs
- **Negative Tests:** Configuration fails gracefully with clear error messages
- **Security Tests:** No hardcoded secrets present

### Expected Environment Variables
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: Research capability (Phase 0)
- `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`: Data storage (Phase 1 Stage 4)
- `MAKE_API_KEY`: Automation workflows (Phase 1 Stage 5)
- `NETLIFY_API_TOKEN`: Deployment (Phase 1 Stage 6)
- `CLAUDE_API_KEY`: Content generation (Phase 1 Stage 5)

### Negative Test Purpose
Validates error handling for common configuration issues:
1. **Missing env var:** Tests credential validation
2. **Malformed YAML:** Tests parsing error reporting
3. **Invalid path:** Tests file validation

### Important Decisions
- Validation log is cumulative (append to existing log)
- Failed validation requires fix and re-test (no incomplete configs)
- Negative tests ensure graceful failure (no cryptic errors)
- Security scan is mandatory (no secrets in config)
- All validation results documented for Phase 1 handoff

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- Manual configuration loading test
- YAML syntax validation
- Security scanning (grep for secrets)
- Negative test execution

**Validation Requirements:**
- Configuration loads without errors
- All required sections present
- File paths valid or documented as "will create"
- Environment variables use correct syntax
- No hardcoded secrets present
- Checkpoint logic reasonable
- Negative tests pass (graceful failures)
- Results documented in validation log
- Validation committed to Git
