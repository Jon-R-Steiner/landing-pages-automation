# Story 1.1.2: Design Living Documentation Template

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** Phase 0 developer,
**I want** a living documentation template with structured sections,
**so that** Phase 1 agents can use documentation-as-code patterns with prescriptive and reflective sections.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Template file created at `.bmad-core/templates/living-doc-tmpl.yaml`
2. Template includes three required sections: Prescriptive (before implementation), Reflective (after testing), Evolution History
3. YAML structure follows existing BMAD template patterns (validated against `.bmad-core/templates/*.yaml` examples)
4. Template includes metadata fields: id, name, version, output format, filename pattern
5. Template structure documented with placeholder examples (detailed usage examples deferred until first agent uses template)
6. Template committed to Git with message: `feat: add living documentation template for agent workflows`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Review existing BMAD template patterns (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Read existing templates from `.bmad-core/templates/` directory
  - [ ] Identify common YAML structure patterns
  - [ ] Note metadata field requirements
  - [ ] Document template conventions to follow
- [ ] Create living documentation template file (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `.bmad-core/templates/living-doc-tmpl.yaml`
  - [ ] Set up basic YAML structure
  - [ ] Add template header and comments
- [ ] Add metadata fields (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add `id` field (unique template identifier)
  - [ ] Add `name` field (human-readable template name)
  - [ ] Add `version` field (template version number)
  - [ ] Add `output.format` field (markdown)
  - [ ] Add `output.filename` pattern field
- [ ] Define Prescriptive section (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create "Prescriptive" section structure
  - [ ] Add guidance for before-implementation content
  - [ ] Include placeholder examples
  - [ ] Document section purpose and usage
- [ ] Define Reflective section (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create "Reflective" section structure
  - [ ] Add guidance for after-testing content
  - [ ] Include placeholder examples
  - [ ] Document section purpose and usage
- [ ] Define Evolution History section (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create "Evolution History" section structure
  - [ ] Add guidance for tracking changes over time
  - [ ] Include placeholder examples
  - [ ] Document section purpose and usage
- [ ] Document template structure (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add comments explaining each section
  - [ ] Provide placeholder examples
  - [ ] Note that detailed usage examples will come later
  - [ ] Include guidance for Phase 1 agents
- [ ] Validate against existing patterns (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Compare structure with existing templates
  - [ ] Ensure YAML syntax is valid
  - [ ] Verify metadata fields match conventions
  - [ ] Confirm structure consistency
- [ ] Commit template to Git (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Review template for completeness
  - [ ] Stage file with `git add`
  - [ ] Create commit with message: `feat: add living documentation template for agent workflows`
  - [ ] Verify commit was created successfully

## Dev Notes

### Context
Fourth story in Phase 0 Epic 1. Creates reusable documentation template for Phase 1 agents to follow documentation-as-code patterns. This template extends existing BMAD template patterns with two-tier context management.

### Key Information
- **Template Location:** `.bmad-core/templates/living-doc-tmpl.yaml`
- **Template Pattern Reference:** Review `.bmad-core/templates/*.yaml` for existing patterns
- **Three Required Sections:**
  1. **Prescriptive:** Written before implementation (requirements, plans, decisions)
  2. **Reflective:** Written after testing (lessons learned, actual vs. expected, improvements)
  3. **Evolution History:** Tracks changes over time (versions, modifications, rationale)

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Story 0.1 (requires `.bmad-core/templates/` directory)
- **Blocks:** Story 1.3 (two-tier strategy builds on this template)
- **Informs:** Phase 1 agents (will use this template for documentation)

### BMAD Template Conventions
- YAML format required
- Metadata section at top (id, name, version)
- Output section specifies format and filename pattern
- Sections array defines document structure
- Comments explain purpose and usage

### Important Decisions
- Template provides structure, not detailed examples (examples deferred until first usage)
- Three-section approach separates planning, reflection, and history
- YAML structure must match existing BMAD patterns for consistency
- Template designed for agent consumption (clear, structured, actionable)

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required (template definition)
- Manual YAML syntax validation
- Structural comparison with existing templates

**Validation Requirements:**
- YAML must be valid and parseable
- Structure must match existing BMAD template patterns
- All three required sections must be present
- Metadata fields must be complete
- Template must be committed to Git
