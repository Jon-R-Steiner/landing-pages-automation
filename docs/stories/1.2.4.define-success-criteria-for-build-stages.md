# Story 1.2.4: Define Success Criteria for All Build Stages

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Phase 0 developer,
**I want** success criteria from build stage definitions integrated into session configuration,
**so that** dev-agent has automated validation gates to detect when stages complete successfully during Phase 1 autonomous execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Session configuration (Story 2.3) `success_criteria` section maps all 6 stage exit criteria from Story 2.2
2. Each stage criterion expressed as: validation command (e.g., `npm test`, `npm run build`, `git status`), expected output/exit code, failure handling instruction (retry, checkpoint, abort)
3. Stage 1 (Project Setup) success criteria include: Monorepo npm workspaces configured, packages/shared types created, lib/placeholders.ts implemented with 8 categories, next.config.js + tailwind.config.js + middleware.ts created, TypeScript compiles without errors
4. Stage 2 (Frontend Foundation) success criteria include: App Router structure created ([slug] + [location]/[slug] routes), Root layout with GTM implemented, globals.css with Tailwind configured, Next.js builds successfully, placeholder images loading correctly
5. Stage 3 (Multi-Step Form) success criteria include: MultiStepForm orchestrator component created, Step1BasicInfo + Step2ProjectDetails + Step3TCPAConsent components functional, FormContext + MarketingContext providers working, Zod validation schemas (step1-schema, step2-schema, step3-schema) in packages/shared, reCAPTCHA v3 integrated, form submission flow tested
6. Stage 4 (Airtable Integration) success criteria include: Netlify Functions deployed (submit-form, validate-recaptcha, webhook-make-com routes), AirtableService with CRUD operations functional, RecaptchaService with score validation working, DuplicateDetectionService (5-min window) tested, form submissions successfully writing to Airtable
7. Stage 5 (Make.com Automation) success criteria include: Make.com Scenario 1 (content generation) configured and tested, Make.com Scenario 2 (deployment trigger) configured and tested, Claude API integration functional (content + PMax assets), Netlify build hook triggering successfully
8. Stage 6 (Deployment & Testing) success criteria include: Netlify production deployment successful, DNS/domain configured, Playwright E2E tests pass (form submission, validation, thank-you page), Core Web Vitals validated (LCP <2.5s, INP <200ms, CLS <0.1), Lighthouse score ≥90

## Dev Notes

### Context
Fourth story in Phase 0 Epic 2. Extends session configuration from Story 2.3 with detailed success criteria for all 6 build stages. These criteria enable dev-agent to validate autonomous progress and detect stage completion.

### Key Information
- **Config Location:** `Landing Pages Automation/claude-session-config.yaml` (update from Story 2.3)
- **Source:** Exit criteria from `docs/phase-1-build-stages.md` (Story 2.2)
- **Format:** Validation commands with expected outcomes and failure handling

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Stories 2.2 (build stages), 2.3 (session config)
- **Blocks:** Story 2.5 (validation of configuration)
- **Informs:** Dev-agent autonomous validation during Phase 1

### Success Criteria Structure
Each criterion includes:
1. **Validation Command:** Executable command (npm, git, curl, etc.)
2. **Expected Output:** Exit code or output pattern
3. **Failure Handling:** retry (transient), checkpoint (recoverable), abort (critical)

### Validation Command Examples
- `npm run build`: Exit code 0 (success)
- `npm test`: Exit code 0, all tests pass
- `tsc --noEmit`: Exit code 0, no type errors
- `git status`: Clean working directory
- `curl [url]`: HTTP 200 response

### Stage Dependencies
- Stage N cannot start until Stage N-1 success criteria met
- Dev-agent checks criteria automatically at stage transitions
- Failed criteria trigger failure handling (retry/checkpoint/abort)

### Important Decisions
- Success criteria are automatable (no manual verification)
- Validation commands are deterministic (consistent results)
- Failure handling preserves state for recovery
- All criteria map directly to exit criteria from Story 2.2
- Configuration remains testable and version-controlled

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required (configuration extension)
- Manual validation command verification
- Completeness check against Stage 2.2 exit criteria

**Validation Requirements:**
- All 6 stages have success criteria defined
- Each criterion has validation command
- Expected outputs specified
- Failure handling defined for each criterion
- All criteria map to Story 2.2 exit criteria
- Configuration remains valid YAML
- Document committed to Git

### Completion Notes
- **Success Criteria Section Added:** Extended claude-session-config.yaml with comprehensive validation gates
- **45 Total Validation Gates Defined** across all 6 stages:
  - Stage 1 (Project Setup): 6 gates (monorepo, types, placeholders, configs, TypeScript, dev server)
  - Stage 2 (Frontend Foundation): 6 gates (routes, GTM, Tailwind, build, images, TypeScript)
  - Stage 3 (Multi-Step Form): 8 gates (orchestrator, steps, contexts, schemas, reCAPTCHA, tests, TypeScript)
  - Stage 4 (Airtable Integration): 7 gates (functions, services, tests, env vars, TypeScript)
  - Stage 5 (Make.com Automation): 7 gates (scenarios, Claude API, build hook, PMax, manual tests)
  - Stage 6 (Deployment & Testing): 11 gates (deployment, DNS, E2E, Core Web Vitals, Lighthouse, env vars, SSL)
- **Validation Command Format:** command, expected output (exit_code/output pattern), on_failure (retry/checkpoint/abort)
- **Failure Handling Types:**
  - retry: Transient failures (network, API rate limits) - 3x with backoff
  - checkpoint: Recoverable failures (tests, validation) - save state for debugging
  - abort: Critical failures (compilation, dependencies) - stop execution
- **All Criteria Map to Story 1.2.2:** Direct mapping from phase-1-build-stages.md exit criteria
- **Configuration Version:** Updated from 1.0 to 1.1
- **Time:** ~30 minutes
- **Commit:** 3a57ce3
