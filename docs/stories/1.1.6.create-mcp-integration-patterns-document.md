# Story 1.1.6: Create MCP Integration Patterns Document

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** dev-agent (Phase 1),
**I want** documented MCP integration patterns for Airtable, Make.com, and Netlify,
**so that** I can implement third-party integrations following best practices with fallback strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Integration patterns document created at `docs/mcp-integration-patterns.md`
2. Document provides implementation guidance for each MCP based on research findings:
   - Airtable MCP: CRUD operations, authentication patterns, error handling
   - Make.com: MCP usage if available OR HTTP/REST fallback with example API calls
   - Netlify: MCP usage if available OR HTTP/REST fallback with deployment patterns
3. For each integration, document: authentication requirements, common operations (with code examples), error handling patterns, rate limiting considerations
4. Include environment variable reference: `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`, `MAKE_API_KEY` (if used), `NETLIFY_API_TOKEN` (if used)
5. Include fallback strategies for scenarios where MCPs are unavailable or rate-limited
6. Document committed to Git with message: `docs: create MCP integration patterns for dev-agent reference`

  - [ ] Provide HTTP/REST alternatives for each service
  - [ ] Document graceful degradation patterns
  - [ ] Include retry and backoff strategies
- [ ] Commit patterns document to Git (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Review document for completeness

  - [ ] Stage file with `git add`
  - [ ] Create commit with message: `docs: create MCP integration patterns for dev-agent reference`
  - [ ] Verify commit was created successfully

## Dev Notes

### Context
Eighth and final story in Phase 0 Epic 1. Synthesizes MCP research from Stories 1.4 and 1.5 with Airtable MCP knowledge to create comprehensive integration guide for Phase 1 dev-agent.

### Key Information
- **Document Location:** `docs/mcp-integration-patterns.md`
- **Research Sources:**
  - `docs/mcp-research/make-com-mcp.md` (Story 1.4)
  - `docs/mcp-research/netlify-mcp.md` (Story 1.5)
  - Airtable MCP documentation (Context7 or web search)
- **Three Services Covered:**
  1. **Airtable:** Data storage, CRUD operations, duplicate detection
  2. **Make.com:** Workflow automation, content generation, webhooks
  3. **Netlify:** Deployment, serverless functions, build hooks

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Stories 1.4, 1.5 (requires MCP research findings)
- **Blocks:** Phase 1 Stories (Epic 2 and beyond depend on this guide)
- **Informs:** Phase 1 Stages 4, 5, 6 (Airtable, Make.com, Netlify integration)

### Integration Requirements from Architecture
- **Airtable (Stage 4):** Form submissions, duplicate detection (5-min window), CRUD via AirtableService
- **Make.com (Stage 5):** Content generation, PMax assets, deployment triggers
- **Netlify (Stage 6):** Serverless functions, production deployment, webhooks

### Important Decisions
- Patterns document is dev-agent's primary integration reference
- Code examples must be functional and ready to use
- Fallback strategies ensure resilience
- Environment variables centrally documented
- Document structure mirrors Phase 1 implementation stages

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required (documentation artifact)
- Code examples must be syntactically valid
- Cross-reference validation with research documents

**Validation Requirements:**
- All three services documented completely
- Authentication patterns clearly explained
- Code examples provided for common operations
- Error handling patterns documented
- Rate limiting considerations noted
- Fallback strategies defined
- Environment variables listed
- Document committed to Git
