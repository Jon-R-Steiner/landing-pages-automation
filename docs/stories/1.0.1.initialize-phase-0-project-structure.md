# Story 1.0.1: Initialize Phase 0 Project Structure

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** Phase 0 developer,
**I want** a properly initialized project structure with necessary directories and Git configuration,
**so that** all subsequent Phase 0 work has the correct foundation to build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Verify Git repository exists in `web-bundles` workspace root (if not, initialize with `git init`)
2. Create Phase 0 directory structure if it doesn't exist:
   - `Landing Pages Automation/docs/` (root documentation folder)
   - `Landing Pages Automation/docs/mcp-research/` (for MCP research findings)
   - `.bmad-core/templates/` (for living documentation template)
3. Verify `.gitignore` file exists and includes standard exclusions: `.env*`, `node_modules/`, `.DS_Store`, `*.log`, `.claude/local-*`
4. Create `Landing Pages Automation/docs/README.md` with Phase 0 project overview and deliverables list
5. Verify directory structure with `tree` command or manual inspection showing all folders created
6. Initial commit created if any new directories added with message: `chore: initialize Phase 0 project structure`
7. Document structure validation in `Landing Pages Automation/docs/phase-0-validation-log.md`

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Verify Git repository initialization (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Check if `.git` directory exists in `web-bundles` workspace root

  - [ ] Verify Git is properly initialized with `git status`
- [ ] Create Phase 0 directory structure (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `Landing Pages Automation/docs/` directory
  - [ ] Create `Landing Pages Automation/docs/mcp-research/` subdirectory
  - [ ] Create `.bmad-core/templates/` directory
  - [ ] Verify all directories created successfully
- [ ] Validate and configure .gitignore (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Check if `.gitignore` file exists in workspace root
  - [ ] If missing, create `.gitignore` file
  - [ ] Add standard exclusions: `.env*`, `node_modules/`, `.DS_Store`, `*.log`, `.claude/local-*`
  - [ ] Verify .gitignore contains all required patterns
- [ ] Create Phase 0 README documentation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create `Landing Pages Automation/docs/README.md`
  - [ ] Document Phase 0 project overview
  - [ ] List all Phase 0 deliverables
  - [ ] Include links to key documentation files
- [ ] Verify directory structure (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Run `tree` command or manual directory inspection
  - [ ] Confirm all required folders are present
  - [ ] Document structure in validation log
- [ ] Create initial Git commit (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Stage all new files and directories with `git add`
  - [ ] Create commit with message: `chore: initialize Phase 0 project structure`
  - [ ] Verify commit was created successfully
- [ ] Document validation results (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Create `Landing Pages Automation/docs/phase-0-validation-log.md`
  - [ ] Log directory structure verification
  - [ ] Log Git initialization status
  - [ ] Include timestamp and any notes

## Dev Notes

### Context
This is the first story in Phase 0 (Epic 1: Foundation Infrastructure). All other Phase 0 stories depend on this story's completion, as it establishes the foundational directory structure and Git configuration.

### Key Information
- **Workspace Root:** `web-bundles` (existing workspace)
- **New Project Folder:** `Landing Pages Automation/` (created under workspace root)
- **Documentation Root:** `Landing Pages Automation/docs/`
- **BMAD Templates Location:** `.bmad-core/templates/` (for future living documentation template in Story 1.2)
- **MCP Research Location:** `Landing Pages Automation/docs/mcp-research/` (for Stories 1.4-1.6)

### Dependencies
- **Blocks:** Stories 1.0-1.6, 2.1-2.6 (all Phase 0 stories require this structure)
- **Prerequisites:** None (this is the foundational story)

### Git Configuration Notes
- Standard conventional commit format: `chore: initialize Phase 0 project structure`
- Ensure `.gitignore` includes Claude Code local files: `.claude/local-*`
- Validation log must be created to track Phase 0 progress throughout all stories

### Important Decisions
- Directory structure uses "Landing Pages Automation" as project folder name within workspace
- Documentation follows two-tier strategy (will be implemented in Story 1.3)
- Validation log is cumulative across all Phase 0 stories

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required for this story (infrastructure setup)
- Manual verification using `tree` command or directory inspection
- Git status verification with `git status` and `git log`

**Validation Requirements:**
- All directories must exist and be accessible
- .gitignore must contain all required patterns
- Git commit must be present in history
- Validation log must be created and contain initial structure documentation
