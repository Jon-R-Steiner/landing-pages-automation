# Story 1.1.0: Install and Validate Required MCP Servers

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Phase 0 developer,
**I want** all required MCP servers installed and validated before beginning research,
**so that** MCP-dependent stories (1.4, 1.5) can execute without installation blockers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Verify Tavily MCP is installed in Claude Code environment (check available MCP servers list)
2. If Tavily MCP not installed, install following official installation instructions
3. Obtain Tavily API key from https://app.tavily.com and store in environment variable `TAVILY_API_KEY`
4. Test Tavily MCP with simple search query: "test MCP integration" - verify results returned without errors
5. Verify Context7 MCP is available in Claude Code environment (check MCP servers list)
6. If Context7 not available, document alternative approach for Story 1.6 (manual documentation lookup)
7. Create `Landing Pages Automation/docs/mcp-setup-instructions.md` documenting:
   - MCP installation steps performed
   - Environment variables required (with placeholder values, NO actual secrets)
   - MCP activation commands
   - Troubleshooting notes
8. Document environment variables in `Landing Pages Automation/docs/phase-0-env-vars.md`: `TAVILY_API_KEY` (required), others TBD
9. Installation validation logged in `Landing Pages Automation/docs/phase-0-validation-log.md` with:
   - Timestamp of installation
   - MCP versions (if available)
   - Test query results
   - Any warnings or issues encountered
10. MCP setup committed to Git with message: `chore: install and configure required MCP servers for Phase 0`

## Dev Notes

### Context
Second story in Phase 0 Epic 1. This story establishes MCP infrastructure required for research stories (1.4, 1.5, 1.6). Must complete after Story 0.1 (project structure) and before MCP research stories.

### Key Information
- **Required MCPs:** Tavily (critical), Context7 (optional with fallback)
- **Tavily API Key Source:** https://app.tavily.com
- **Environment Variables:** `TAVILY_API_KEY` (required for Stories 1.4, 1.5)
- **Documentation Files:**
  - `Landing Pages Automation/docs/mcp-setup-instructions.md` (setup guide)
  - `Landing Pages Automation/docs/phase-0-env-vars.md` (environment configuration)
  - `Landing Pages Automation/docs/phase-0-validation-log.md` (validation tracking)

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Story 0.1 (requires directory structure and validation log)
- **Blocks:** Stories 1.4, 1.5 (require Tavily MCP for research)

### MCP Configuration Notes
- Tavily MCP is **critical** - Stories 1.4, 1.5 cannot proceed without it
- Context7 MCP is **optional** - Story 1.6 has manual documentation lookup fallback
- Test query validates MCP integration before research stories begin
- Environment variables must **never** contain actual secrets in documentation

### Important Decisions
- MCP setup instructions include troubleshooting for future reference
- Environment variables documented separately for security and clarity
- Validation log is cumulative (append to existing log from Story 0.1)

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required (MCP installation and configuration)
- Manual verification through MCP server listing
- Functional test using Tavily search query

**Validation Requirements:**
- Tavily MCP must appear in available MCP servers list
- Test search query must return results without errors
- Environment variable must be accessible to Claude Code
- All documentation files must be created and contain required information
- Git commit must be present in history
