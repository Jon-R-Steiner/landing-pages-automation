## Dev Notes

### Context
Third story in Phase 0 Epic 1. Creates systematic tracking mechanism for all Phase 0 work. This checklist will be used throughout Phase 0 to track progress and validate completion.

### Key Information
- **Checklist Location:** `Landing Pages Automation/docs/phase-0-checklist.md`
- **Requirements Source:** FR1-FR12 from PRD (docs/prd/requirements.md)
- **Risk Source:** Risks & Mitigation section from PRD (docs/prd/risks-mitigation-strategies.md)
- **Story Dependencies:**
  - 0.1 → {1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6}
  - 1.0 → {1.4, 1.5}
  - {1.4, 1.5, 1.6} → {2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6}

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** Story 0.1 (requires directory structure)
- **Blocks:** None (checklist is tracking tool, doesn't block other stories)
- **Informs:** All Phase 0 stories (provides tracking framework)

### Checklist Requirements
- Must be actionable: each item has clear "how to verify" instructions
- Must be comprehensive: covers all Phase 0 deliverables
- Must show dependencies: developers know what to do in what order
- Must reference risks: high-impact items linked to mitigation strategies

### Important Decisions
- Checklist organized by Epic and Story for clarity
- Pass/fail criteria must be objective and measurable
- Dependencies explicitly documented to prevent out-of-order execution
- Risk references ensure critical items get appropriate attention

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required (documentation artifact)
- Manual review for completeness and clarity
- Validation against FR1-FR12 requirements list

**Validation Requirements:**
- All FR1-FR12 requirements must have corresponding checklist items
- All story dependencies must be documented
- Exit criteria must be measurable
- Document must be committed to Git
