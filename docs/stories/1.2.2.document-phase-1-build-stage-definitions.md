# Story 1.2.2: Document Phase 1 Build Stage Definitions

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Phase 0 developer,
**I want** explicit definitions for all 6 Phase 1 build stages with success criteria,
**so that** dev-agent workflow configuration has measurable validation gates for autonomous progress tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Build stage definitions document created at `docs/phase-1-build-stages.md`
2. All 6 stages defined in BMAD workflow format based on architecture.md v1.5:
   - Stage 1: Project Setup (Monorepo, dependencies, placeholder library)
   - Stage 2: Frontend Foundation (Next.js App Router, routing, layouts, styling)
   - Stage 3: Multi-Step Form (React Hook Form, Zod validation, reCAPTCHA, TCPA)
   - Stage 4: Airtable Integration (Serverless functions, Airtable SDK, duplicate detection)
   - Stage 5: Make.com Automation (Content generation, PMax asset export, deployment hooks)
   - Stage 6: Deployment & Testing (Netlify deployment, E2E tests, Core Web Vitals validation)
3. For each stage, document: entry criteria (what must be complete to start), primary deliverables/artifacts (what this stage produces), exit criteria (objective, testable success conditions), success metrics (specific validation checks)
4. Entry/exit criteria are objective and testable (e.g., "All tests pass" not "Code quality is good")
5. Dependencies between stages explicitly documented (Stage N cannot start until Stage N-1 exit criteria met)
6. Stage definitions map to architecture.md components: Stage 1 (monorepo layout), Stage 2 ([slug]/[location]/[slug] routes), Stage 3 (FormContext + MarketingContext), Stage 4 (AirtableService + RecaptchaService), Stage 5 (Make.com scenarios), Stage 6 (Netlify Functions + Playwright)
7. Build stages committed to Git with message: `docs: define Phase 1 autonomous build stage criteria based on architecture.md v1.5`

## Dev Notes

### Context
Second story in Phase 0 Epic 2. Creates detailed build stage definitions that dev-agent uses for autonomous Phase 1 execution with validation gates. This is the core workflow definition for 30-hour Phase 1 build.

### Key Information
- **Document Location:** `docs/phase-1-build-stages.md`
- **Architecture Source:** `docs/architecture.md` v1.5
- **Stage Count:** 6 stages (Project Setup → Deployment & Testing)
- **Format:** BMAD workflow format with entry/exit criteria

### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites:** None (Epic 2 can start after Epic 1 completes)
- **Blocks:** Story 2.3 (session config references these stages), Story 2.4 (success criteria derived from these stages)
- **Informs:** Dev-agent Phase 1 workflow orchestration

### Stage Progression Pattern
Each stage follows consistent structure:
1. **Entry Criteria:** Objective prerequisites (usually previous stage exit criteria)
2. **Primary Deliverables:** Specific artifacts this stage produces
3. **Exit Criteria:** Measurable success conditions to proceed
4. **Success Metrics:** Validation commands and checks

### Architecture Alignment
- **Stage 1 → Monorepo:** packages/shared, lib/placeholders.ts
- **Stage 2 → App Router:** [slug], [location]/[slug] routes
- **Stage 3 → Form:** MultiStepForm, Context providers, Zod schemas
- **Stage 4 → Airtable:** Services (Airtable, Recaptcha, DuplicateDetection)
- **Stage 5 → Make.com:** Scenarios (content, deployment), Claude API
- **Stage 6 → Deployment:** Netlify, Playwright, Core Web Vitals

### Important Decisions
- Stages must be sequential (dependencies prevent parallel execution)
- Exit criteria must be automatable (dev-agent validates autonomously)
- All criteria are objective and testable (no subjective assessments)
- Stage definitions provide checkpoints for 30-hour autonomous build
- BMAD workflow format ensures consistency with framework

### Testing

**Test Standards:**
- No automated tests required (workflow definition)
- Architecture alignment validation
- Criteria objectivity review

**Validation Requirements:**
- All 6 stages documented completely
- Entry/exit criteria are objective and testable
- Architecture components mapped to stages
- Dependencies explicitly documented
- BMAD workflow format followed
- Document committed to Git
