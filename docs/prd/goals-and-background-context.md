# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

1. **Create comprehensive architecture document** for dev-agent to build Landing Pages Automation system with complete technical specifications, component definitions, and implementation guidance
2. **Implement living documentation system** achieving ≥30% token reduction vs. monolithic approach through two-tier context management for reusable documentation patterns
3. **Research and map MCP landscape** for Airtable, Make.com, Netlify with integration patterns and fallback strategies documented for dev-agent usage
4. **Design session starter configuration** enabling dev-agent autonomous 30-hour Phase 1 execution with success criteria for all 6 build stages
5. **Complete Phase 0 in ≤4 days** with all deliverables validated against success criteria and context saved for Phase 1 dev-agent handoff

## Background Context

Autonomous AI-assisted development faces a critical bottleneck: **human coordination overhead**. Manual orchestration of multi-agent workflows creates massive inefficiency—even with AI coding assistants, developers spend 50%+ of session time coordinating handoffs rather than creating value. For a solo developer, this coordination tax makes complex multi-stage projects mathematically impossible within realistic timeframes.

**Landing Pages Automation** serves as proof-of-concept for eliminating this bottleneck through autonomous dev-agent execution. However, before autonomous build execution can begin, foundational infrastructure must exist. **This PRD defines Phase 0: Pre-Core Development**—creating comprehensive architecture documentation, living documentation systems, MCP integration patterns, and session configurations that enable dev-agent autonomous execution. Phase 0 deliverables become reusable framework assets for all future autonomous development projects, not just this landing pages system.

## Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-10-07 | 1.3 | **PO VALIDATION ADDITIONS**: Added Story 0.1 (Initialize Phase 0 Project Structure) and Story 1.0 (Install and Validate Required MCP Servers) to Epic 1 based on PO Master Checklist validation findings. Updated Story 1.1 AC3 to reference new stories' dependencies. Updated epic-list.md with story count (8 stories in Epic 1). Total story count: 14 stories (Epic 1: 8, Epic 2: 6). Rationale: PO validation identified missing foundational stories for project scaffolding and MCP installation that are prerequisites for subsequent work | Sarah (Product Owner) |
| 2025-10-07 | 1.2 | **SCOPE PIVOT**: Aligned PRD with architecture.md v1.5 decision to use single dev-agent instead of creating specialized agents. Removed Epic 2 (Agent Creation & Validation - 5 stories obsolete), updated Goals to remove "Create 3 specialized BMAD agents", updated Epic 1 to remove agent-focused deliverables, updated Epic 3 to frame session config for dev-agent consumption (not multi-agent orchestration), removed FR9-FR14 (agent creation requirements), removed NFR1/NFR6/NFR7 (agent validation requirements), updated Technical Assumptions to remove BMAD Orchestrator coordination assumptions, updated Risks to remove agent integration and orchestration risks. Story count reduced from 17 to 12 stories (29% scope reduction). Rationale: Architecture pivot follows BMad Method principle "Dev Agents Must Be Lean" - single dev-agent consuming comprehensive architecture.md is more effective than fragmenting context across multiple specialized agents | Sarah (Product Owner) |
| 2025-10-07 | 1.1 | Updated Phase 1 build stages to align with architecture.md v1.5: Changed from 5 generic stages to 6 specific implementation stages (Project Setup, Frontend Foundation, Multi-Step Form, Airtable Integration, Make.com Automation, Deployment & Testing). Updated FR16, FR18, Story 3.2 AC2+AC6, Story 3.4 AC1-8 with architecture-specific components and success criteria. Added explicit mappings to monorepo layout, Next.js routing ([slug]/[location]/[slug]), FormContext/MarketingContext, AirtableService/RecaptchaService, Make.com scenarios, Netlify Functions, and Playwright E2E tests. Rationale: PRD references must match actual architecture implementation for dev-agent Phase 1 execution | Winston (Architect Agent) |
| 2025-10-06 | 1.0 | Initial PRD creation | PM Agent |
