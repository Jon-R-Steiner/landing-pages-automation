# Risks & Mitigation Strategies

## **Risk 1: Runtime Model Ambiguity**

**Concern:** Technical Assumptions state "N/A - Infrastructure Phase" for service architecture without clarifying the runtime model for agent execution.

**Impact:** Architect may be unclear about what they're designing Phase 1 architecture for, leading to misalignment.

**Mitigation:**
- **Clarify during execution:** Agent files are prompt templates with YAML metadata, activated via Claude Code slash commands (`/BMad:agents:{agent_id}`)
- **Runtime environment:** Claude Code interpreter parses YAML frontmatter and follows agent instructions
- **No compilation/build step:** Agents are documentation-driven, not executable binaries

**Owner:** Already addressed - architecture.md v1.5 provides complete specifications

---

## **Risk 2: Validation Automation Absent**

**Concern:** Manual validation (NFR1-NFR4) doesn't scale and creates quality gaps that will cascade into Phase 1.

**Impact:** HIGH - Broken agent files, invalid configurations, or incorrect documentation structure won't be caught until Phase 1 failures occur.

**Mitigation:**
- **Consider lightweight validation scripts:**
  - `agent-validator.js`: Check YAML frontmatter structure for required fields
  - `token-counter.js`: Measure documentation token counts objectively
  - `config-loader-test.js`: Attempt to load session configuration and report errors
- **Trade-off decision:** Balance automation effort (adds scope to Phase 0) vs. manual validation risk
- **Defer if needed:** Can be added during Phase 0 if time permits, or addressed in Phase 1 when issues surface

**Owner:** Developer during Phase 0 execution (evaluate during Day 2-3)

---

## **Risk 3: BMAD Template Specification Gap**

**Concern:** Requirements reference "BMAD template structure" but don't provide schema definition or annotated example.

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Developer wastes time guessing required fields, leading to rework cycles.

**Mitigation:**
- **Reference existing agents:** Use `.bmad-core/agents/*.md` files as examples during Phase 0
- **Context7 MCP:** Query for BMAD agent patterns and framework documentation
- **Iterative validation:** Create first agent, validate with existing patterns, then apply learning to remaining agents

**Owner:** Developer during Phase 0 execution (Day 2)

---

## **Risk 4: Environment Variable Specification Missing**

**Concern:** NFR9 requires environment variables for credentials but doesn't specify which variables are needed or where they're configured.

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Implementation blocker for FR17 (session configuration creation).

**Mitigation:**
- **Document during execution:** As agents are created and MCPs researched, compile list of required variables:
  - `TAVILY_API_KEY` (for MCP research)
  - `AIRTABLE_API_KEY` (for Integration Specialist agent)
  - `MAKE_API_KEY` (if Make.com integration used)
  - `NETLIFY_API_TOKEN` (if Netlify integration used)
- **Configuration location:** Document in session config whether to use `.env` file, system variables, or Claude Code settings
- **Defaults for development:** Identify which can use test/mock values vs. requiring real credentials

**Owner:** MCP Integration Patterns document (Story 1.6) during Phase 0 execution

---

## **Risk 5: Token Reduction Baseline Undefined**

**Concern:** NFR2 claims "≥30% token reduction" but no baseline measurement exists to validate against.

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Key performance claim is unverifiable without objective measurement.

**Mitigation:**
- **Measure baseline during Phase 0:**
  - Step 1: Measure current documentation token count (full history load)
  - Step 2: Implement two-tier system
  - Step 3: Measure archive-only load token count
  - Step 4: Calculate percentage reduction
- **Tool selection:** Identify token counting utility (OpenAI tiktoken, Anthropic token counter, or approximation method)
- **Document actual reduction:** Report real percentage achieved vs. 30% target in Phase 0 completion report

**Owner:** Developer during living documentation implementation (Day 1)

---

## **Risk 6: 30-Hour Session Capability Unproven**

**Concern:** Entire Phase 1 plan depends on Claude Code supporting 30-hour autonomous sessions, but this capability has never been validated.

**Impact:** CRITICAL - If 30-hour sessions aren't feasible, Phase 1 plan fails and Phase 0 infrastructure is built for impossible use case.

**Mitigation:**
- **Consider validation experiment:** Run 4-hour autonomous test during Phase 0 with checkpoints every 30 minutes
  - Validate: Context preservation across checkpoints
  - Validate: Checkpoint/resume functionality
  - Validate: Autonomous execution without human intervention
- **Early validation advantages:**
  - Proves concept before investing in full Phase 1
  - Identifies session management issues early
  - Provides confidence in Phase 0 deliverable viability
- **Trade-off:** Adds 4-6 hours to Phase 0 timeline (extends to 5 days instead of 4)
- **Defer decision:** Can be evaluated during Day 3 after session config creation

**Owner:** PM agent decision during Phase 0 (Day 3 checkpoint)

---

## **Risk 7: Integration Testing Gaps**

**Concern:** Requirements validate individual components (architecture, templates, configs, MCP patterns) but don't test Phase 0 deliverables work cohesively for dev-agent.

**Impact:** HIGH - Components may be individually valid but collectively insufficient for dev-agent Phase 1 execution.

**Mitigation:**
- **Manual integration validation checklist:**
  - Test 1: Verify architecture.md references all MCP integration patterns from research documents
  - Test 2: Verify session config context files list includes all necessary Phase 1 documents
  - Test 3: Verify build stage definitions (FR10) align with architecture.md implementation stages
  - Test 4: Verify living documentation template structure compatible with architecture documentation patterns
- **Add to Phase 0 completion criteria:** Integration validation tests must pass before Phase 0 marked complete
- **Low overhead:** Manual review, no automation needed for documentation alignment validation

**Owner:** QA validation during Phase 0 Day 4

---

## **Risk 8: Timeline Breakdown Absent**

**Concern:** NFR5 requires "4 calendar days" completion but provides no day-by-day deliverable targets.

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Developer can't self-assess progress or identify delays early.

**Mitigation:**
- **Proposed timeline breakdown:**
  - **Day 1:** MCP Research (FR5-FR8) + Living Doc Template (FR2-FR4)
  - **Day 2:** MCP Integration Patterns (FR7) + Architecture Validation
  - **Day 3:** Session Config (FR9-FR12) + Integration Testing
  - **Day 4:** Full validation + Context save (`/sc:save`) + Handoff documentation
- **Checkpoints:** End-of-day review against deliverable targets
- **Slack built-in:** Foundation phase (FR2-FR8) can run in parallel, provides buffer

**Owner:** Developer self-management during Phase 0 execution

---

## **Risk 9: Git Workflow Undefined**

**Concern:** NFR10 requires "meaningful commit messages following project conventions" but conventions aren't specified.

**Impact:** LOW - Creates inconsistency but doesn't block progress.

**Mitigation:**
- **Adopt Conventional Commits:** Use `feat:`, `docs:`, `chore:` prefixes
- **Commit frequency:** After each major deliverable (agent file, template, config)
- **Branch strategy:** Work on feature branch `feature/phase-0-foundation`, merge to main after validation
- **No sign-off required:** Solo developer, async work, lightweight process

**Owner:** Developer during Phase 0 execution (establish on Day 1)

---

## **Risk 10: Failure Recovery Procedures Missing**

**Concern:** No documented procedure for validation failures or Phase 1 discovery that Phase 0 outputs are unusable.

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Delays and confusion when issues arise.

**Mitigation:**
- **Validation failure procedure:**
  - Document specific issue in Git commit message
  - Fix in place (don't delete and restart)
  - Re-validate after fix
  - Continue if fix verified
- **Git revert strategy:** Tag commits before each major deliverable for rollback points
- **Phase 1 rollback option:** Define minimum viable Phase 0 (core agents only, defer optional features)
- **Escalation path:** If validation repeatedly fails, reassess requirements or timeline

**Owner:** PM agent during Phase 0 execution oversight

---

## **Risk 11: Architecture Document Completeness**

**Concern:** dev-agent Phase 1 execution depends entirely on architecture.md completeness - any missing specifications will block autonomous implementation.

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Incomplete architecture forces dev-agent to halt for human clarification, defeating autonomous execution goal.

**Mitigation:**
- **Architecture completeness checklist during Phase 0 validation:**
  - ✅ All data models fully specified (TypeScript interfaces, relationships)
  - ✅ All API endpoints documented (request/response schemas, error handling)
  - ✅ All components defined (frontend + backend with clear responsibilities)
  - ✅ All external integrations documented (Airtable, Make.com, Netlify, reCAPTCHA)
  - ✅ Deployment architecture complete (Netlify configuration, environment variables)
  - ✅ Testing strategy defined (unit, integration, E2E with Playwright)
- **Validation gate:** During Story 2.6 (Phase 0 Completion Validation), explicitly verify architecture.md contains sufficient detail for dev-agent autonomous execution
- **Acceptance criteria:** Each build stage (FR10) must have corresponding architecture sections providing implementation guidance

**Owner:** Product Owner during Phase 0 validation (Day 4)
