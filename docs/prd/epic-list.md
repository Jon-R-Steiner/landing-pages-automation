# Epic List

## Epic 1: Foundation Infrastructure

**Goal:** Establish living documentation system and MCP integration research foundation to enable dev-agent Phase 1 execution with comprehensive context.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Project Structure Initialization & MCP Server Setup
- Pre-Core Development Checklist
- Living Documentation Template with two-tier strategy
- MCP Research (Make.com, Netlify, Airtable)
- MCP Integration Patterns Document (dev-agent reference)

**Story Count:** 8 stories (Stories 0.1, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6)

**Purpose:** Provides reusable documentation patterns and MCP integration knowledge that dev-agent will consume during Phase 1 autonomous execution.

## Epic 2: Session Configuration & Phase 1 Preparation

**Goal:** Configure session starter for dev-agent with Phase 1 workflow definition and comprehensive context files, enabling autonomous 30-hour Phase 1 execution.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Phase 1 Context Files List (architecture.md, PRD, MCP research, living docs)
- Phase 1 Build Stage Definitions (6 implementation stages)
- Session Starter Configuration (dev-agent activation)
- Phase 0 Completion Validation

**Purpose:** Enables dev-agent to load complete project context and execute Phase 1 build autonomously with validation gates.
