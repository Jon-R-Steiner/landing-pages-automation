# Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2025-10-07 | 1.5 | Expanded Image Asset Strategy with comprehensive placeholder library: Added `lib/placeholders.ts` centralized configuration with 8 image categories (heroes, testimonials, badges, before-after, process, team, portfolio, icons, logos) totaling 50+ placeholder definitions, each with specific aspect ratios and dimensions. Included `getPlaceholder()` helper function with graceful fallback handling. Added complete usage examples for testimonials, proof sections, before/after galleries, and dynamic images. Expanded Phase 2 migration with detailed public/images/ directory structure (8 categories with specific file organization), asset acquisition guidance, optimization requirements, and fallback strategy for missing images. Updated Monorepo Layout to include placeholders.ts and complete public/images/ structure. Rationale: Eliminates developer confusion when components need images without file paths - provides zero-ambiguity solution for any image scenario in Phase 1 | Winston (Architect Agent) |
| 2025-10-07 | 1.4 | Added comprehensive URL Structure & Routing section: Single subdomain strategy with geographic and non-geographic URL patterns, Google Ads optimization guidelines, Next.js dual routing implementation (`[slug]` and `[location]/[slug]`), UTM parameter handling, SEO/canonical URL policy, Airtable schema additions (`geo_targeting`, `location_slug`, `service_slug`, `full_path` formula), Netlify trailing slash redirect configuration, URL validation rules, and reserved path patterns. Updated Monorepo Layout with new `[location]/[slug]` route structure and `middleware.ts` for URL normalization. Rationale: URL structure is critical for Google Ads Quality Score, ad relevance, and cost-per-click optimization - explicit specification ensures dev-agent implements Google Ads best practices | Winston (Architect Agent) |
| 2025-10-07 | 1.3 | Removed GitHub Actions/CI dependencies: Eliminated `.github/workflows/` from Monorepo Layout, updated Tech Stack CI/CD to "Netlify Built-in", simplified High Level Architecture diagram (Git Push â†’ Netlify direct), removed GitHub Actions workflow specifications, updated deployment process to Netlify-native only. Rationale: Netlify handles all CI/CD natively with automatic builds on Git push, preview deployments for PRs, and built-in testing capabilities - separate GitHub Actions adds unnecessary complexity | Winston (Architect Agent) |
| 2025-10-07 | 1.2 | Monorepo Layout completeness review: Fixed TypeScript path alias (`"@/*": ["./*"]`), added next.config.js specification with Turbopack and image optimization, added tailwind.config.js with design system tokens from front-end-spec, added globals.css with Tailwind directives and custom styles, added .gitignore specification, clarified hero image strategy (Phase 1 placeholder URLs, Phase 2 physical files) | Winston (Architect Agent) |
| 2025-10-07 | 1.1 | Aligned with front-end-spec.md v1.3: Added Content Generation Strategy, Frontend Implementation Documents references, Visual Design Authority clarification, Image Asset Strategy (placeholder images), Document Dependencies matrix; Updated Core Web Vitals from FID to INP (Google March 2024 standard) | Winston (Architect Agent) |
| 2025-10-07 | 1.0 | Initial architecture document creation | Winston (Architect Agent) |
