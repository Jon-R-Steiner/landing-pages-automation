# Frontend Implementation Documents

Dev-agent must reference these four implementation guides during frontend development:

1. **Component Shopping List** (`docs/component-shopping-list.md`)
   - Pre-built component sources with URLs and code snippets
   - Sources: DaisyUI, HyperUI, Tailblocks
   - Exact components for buttons, forms, hero sections, testimonials

2. **Component Customization Guide** (`docs/component-customization-guide.md`)
   - Adaptation patterns for brand guidelines compliance
   - How to modify pre-built components to match design system
   - Color, typography, and spacing overrides

3. **Build Order & Acceptance Criteria** (`docs/build-order-and-acceptance-criteria.md`)
   - Phased implementation sequence with completion gates
   - Clear acceptance criteria for each build phase
   - Dependency management and testing requirements

4. **Playwright Test Scenarios** (`docs/playwright-test-scenarios.md`)
   - Automated validation tests for spec compliance
   - E2E test scenarios for form flows and user journeys
   - Accessibility and performance validation tests

**Implementation Path**: Component Shopping List → Customization Guide → Build Order → Playwright Validation
