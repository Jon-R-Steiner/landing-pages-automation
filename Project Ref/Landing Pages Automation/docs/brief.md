# Project Brief: Landing Pages Automation

---

## Executive Summary

**Landing Pages Automation** is an AI-driven content generation and deployment system designed to produce 500+ high-converting, SEO-optimized landing pages per week for home services contractors. The system leverages Claude AI for content generation, Airtable for workflow orchestration, and Astro for high-performance static site generation.

**Problem:** Manual landing page creation doesn't scale. Current approaches require hours of copywriting, design, and optimization per page, making it impossible for solo developers to serve high-volume client needs.

**Target Market:** Home services contractors (bathroom remodeling, HVAC, roofing, etc.) seeking local SEO dominance through geographic and service-specific landing pages.

**Key Value Proposition:** Autonomous content generation at scale (500 pages/week) with brand consistency, TCPA compliance, and conversion optimization—all managed by a single developer through intelligent agent coordination.

**Current Phase:** Pre-Core Development (Phase 0) focuses on creating the foundational BMAD agent infrastructure, MCP integrations, and documentation systems required before autonomous build execution.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

**Manual coordination doesn't scale to complexity.** As identified in our strategic analysis, the fundamental problem isn't just landing page creation—it's the **human bottleneck** in software development workflows.

#### Landing Pages Workflow Reality

**Manual approach per page:**
- Research keyword: 15 minutes
- Write copy: 45 minutes
- Design layout: 30 minutes
- Optimize SEO: 20 minutes
- Deploy and validate: 10 minutes
- **Total: 2 hours per page**

**The math is impossible:**
- Target: 500 pages/week
- Manual requirement: **1,000 hours/week** (25 full-time employees)
- Even with AI assistance (30min/page): **250 hours/week** (6+ full-time employees)
- **Solo dev reality: 40 hours/week**

**Result:** Without autonomous coordination, the 500 pages/week target is unachievable by orders of magnitude.

#### Agent Coordination Overhead

Even with AI assistance, **manual orchestration creates massive overhead.**

**Specific handoff pattern from original build plan:**
```
Stage 2 (Form System) complete →
  ↓ Human reviews output (5-10min)
  ↓ Human decides next step (3-5min)
  ↓ Human activates Stage 3 agent (2-3min)
  ↓ Stage 3 (Content Generation) complete →
  ↓ Human reviews output (5-10min)
  ↓ ...repeat for 5 stages
```

**Coordination tax per handoff:**
- Context reload: 5-10 minutes
- Decision making: 3-5 minutes
- Agent activation: 2-3 minutes
- **Total: ~15 minutes per handoff**

**For a 5-stage build with 20 agent handoffs:**
- Pure coordination overhead: **5 hours**
- Actual value creation: Remaining time
- **Efficiency loss: 50%+ of session time spent coordinating, not building**

#### Error Recovery Bottleneck

**Real-world example:**

During form integration, Claude encounters TCPA validation error.

**Manual coordination mode:**
1. Developer must stop work, research TCPA requirements: 30 minutes
2. Update documentation with findings: 15 minutes
3. Restart Claude session with new context: 10 minutes
4. Re-run integration with corrections: 20 minutes
- **Total: 75 minutes lost to context switching**
- **Human required: Constant availability for error triage**

**Autonomous coordination mode:**
1. Agent detects error, triggers research sub-agent
2. Research agent consults Context7 MCP for compliance patterns
3. Results written to living documentation automatically
4. Integration agent retries with updated context
- **Total: 5 minutes, zero human intervention**
- **15x faster recovery, runs 24/7**

**The bottleneck:** Humans must be present for every error, blocking progress outside working hours.

### Impact of the Problem

**Quantified impact for solo developer:**

**Productivity Ceiling:**
- Current approach: 5-hour manual orchestration = ~20-30 agent handoffs requiring human intervention
- Lost productivity: ~2-3 hours per day of "coordination overhead" vs. actual value creation
- Scale limitation: Cannot build systems beyond single-person cognitive capacity
- Opportunity cost: Every hour coordinating is an hour not building new capabilities

**For Landing Pages Project:**
- 500 pages/week is mathematically impossible (need 250 hours, have 40)
- Even 50 pages/week would require constant manual oversight
- Error recovery requires 24/7 availability (solo dev can't provide this)

**Strategic Impact:**
- Cannot serve high-volume clients without autonomous coordination
- Cannot compete with agencies that have teams of developers
- Cannot scale business beyond personal time availability

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Current approaches:**

**1. Manual AI Coding**
- Developer prompts Claude for each step
- Loses context between sessions
- Requires constant human intervention
- **Fails at:** Autonomous multi-hour execution

**2. Traditional Automation (Scripts/CI/CD)**
- Lacks intelligence to adapt to errors
- Cannot handle edge cases or evolving requirements
- Requires pre-definition of all scenarios
- **Fails at:** Intelligent decision-making during failures

**3. Agent Frameworks (without BMAD)**
- No standardized patterns for coordination
- No living documentation system
- No learning from failures across sessions
- **Fails at:** Systematic improvement and context preservation

**None enable true autonomous multi-agent coordination for 30-hour sessions.**

### Urgency and Importance

**Why now:**

**1. Claude Code Capability Unlocked**
- 30-hour autonomous sessions are NOW technically possible
- But only with proper agent coordination architecture
- Window to establish best practices before ecosystem matures

**2. Perfect Proof-of-Concept Complexity**
- Landing Pages project is ideal difficulty level
- Complex enough to validate methodology (5 stages, multiple agents, real integrations)
- Manageable enough to complete in reasonable timeframe (weeks, not months)
- Success here proves approach for harder future projects

**3. Compounding Returns on Investment**
- Patterns developed here become **reusable framework assets**
- Every agent created serves multiple future projects
- Living documentation system scales across portfolio
- Meta-reporting infrastructure drives continuous improvement

**4. Future Project Impossibility Without This**

**Concrete examples of upcoming projects that would be impossible with manual coordination:**

- **Multi-tenant SaaS Platform:** Auth + billing + admin + user dashboards + API = 20+ interconnected components requiring coordinated development
- **Real-time Collaboration System:** WebSockets + CRDTs + conflict resolution + presence + permissions = Complex state management across frontend/backend
- **Enterprise Integration Hub:** Connecting 10+ third-party APIs (Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, etc.) with orchestration logic, error handling, retry mechanisms

**Each of these would require:**
- 100+ agent handoffs if done manually
- Coordination overhead exceeding actual development time
- Cognitive load beyond single-person capacity

**Without solving autonomous coordination NOW, these projects remain theoretical.**

### The Foundational Problem

**This is not just about landing pages.** The core problem is: **Without autonomous multi-agent coordination, we cannot achieve superhuman development leverage—the ability for one developer to accomplish what previously required teams.**

Landing Pages Automation is the **proof-of-concept** that validates the methodology for all future work.

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept and Approach

**Build autonomous agent coordination infrastructure FIRST, then use it to build the landing pages system.**

The solution is **two-phased:**

**Phase 0: Pre-Core Development** (Focus of this brief)
- Create specialized BMAD agents for the build
- Establish living documentation system with two-tier context management
- Research and integrate required MCPs (Airtable, Make.com, Netlify)
- Define success criteria and validation gates
- Create session starter configuration for autonomous execution

**Phase 1: Core Development** (Autonomous 30-hour build session)
- BMAD orchestrator coordinates specialist agents
- Event-driven architecture triggers agent workflows
- Documentation-as-code drives implementation
- Meta-reporting provides visibility and learning
- Agents work in parallel where dependencies allow

### Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions

**1. Living Documentation System**
- **Prescriptive docs** (before code) + **Reflective docs** (after testing) = feedback loop
- **Two-tier context:** Active docs always loaded, archive loaded on-demand via keywords
- **Documentation-as-code:** Docs drive builds, not the reverse

**2. BMAD Agent Specialization**
- Purpose-built agents: `integration_specialist`, `content_strategist`, `workflow_automations`
- Each agent knows which MCPs to use and when
- Clear handoff protocols and success criteria

**3. Event-Driven Coordination**
- No manual handoffs—agents trigger next agents via events
- Example: `PageGenerated` event → triggers QualityCheck agent → triggers Deploy agent
- Loosely coupled, resilient to failures

**4. Meta-Reporting for Visibility**
- Track build progress, agent activity, performance metrics, error patterns
- Solo dev can review session outcomes, not babysit execution
- Learning feeds back into documentation improvements

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

**Leverages existing strengths:**
- **BMAD framework** already solves agent structure, task workflows, documentation patterns
- **Claude Code** provides 30-hour autonomous execution capability
- **MCP ecosystem** (Context7, Serena, Airtable, etc.) provides specialized capabilities
- **Your SuperClaude customizations** add token efficiency, research depth, business analysis

**Addresses root causes:**
- **Human bottleneck:** Removed from coordination loop (agents coordinate)
- **Context loss:** Living docs preserve context across sessions
- **Error recovery:** Autonomous with learning (documented for improvement)
- **Scaling:** Patterns reusable across ALL future projects

**Proof-of-concept sized right:**
- Complex enough to validate (5 stages, multiple agents, real integrations)
- Manageable enough to complete (weeks, not months)
- High-value outcome (500 pages/week capability unlocked)

### High-Level Vision for the Product

**Immediate:** Landing Pages Automation produces 500 SEO-optimized, TCPA-compliant pages/week for home services contractors

**Near-term:** BMAD methodology proven for autonomous multi-agent development

**Long-term:** Superhuman development framework applicable to ANY software project—SaaS platforms, collaboration tools, enterprise integrations—enabling solo developers to build systems previously requiring teams

---

## MVP Scope

### Phase 0: Pre-Core Development (MVP for this brief)

#### Core Features (Must Have)

**1. Three New BMAD Agents Created**
- `integration_specialist.md` - Handles Airtable, Make.com, Netlify integrations with MCP references
- `content_strategist.md` - Claude prompt engineering, brand voice, content templates
- `workflow_automations.md` - GitHub Actions, deployment pipelines, testing automation
- **Rationale:** These are the specialized capabilities missing from current BMAD agent roster

**2. Living Documentation System Implemented**
- Template structure: Prescriptive + Reflective + Evolution History sections
- Two-tier context strategy: Active docs (current + last 3 versions) + Archive (full history)
- Keyword-based archive loading: Automatic detection of "why was this built", "history", "past errors"
- **Rationale:** Foundation for Documentation-as-Code approach and context management

**3. MCP Research & Integration Guide**
- Confirmed availability: Airtable MCP ✅, Make.com MCP (research), Netlify MCP (research)
- Agent → MCP mapping documented (which agents use which MCPs when)
- Integration patterns for Context7, Serena, Sequential, Tavily in agent workflows
- **Rationale:** Agents need to know which tools to use and when

**4. Session Starter Configuration**
- `claude-session-config.yaml` template with context files, credentials structure, checkpoints
- Success criteria defined for each Phase 1 build stage
- Evolution flags: current state (human checkpoints) → target state (full automation)
- **Rationale:** Enables autonomous 30-hour session kickoff for Phase 1

**5. Pre-Core Development Checklist**
- Sequenced tasks for Phase 0 completion
- Exit criteria before moving to Phase 1
- Validation gates to ensure readiness
- **Rationale:** Clear roadmap prevents scope creep and ensures nothing is forgotten

#### Out of Scope for MVP

- **No actual landing pages code** - That's Phase 1
- **No Astro/Tailwind setup** - Infrastructure comes in Phase 1
- **No form components or content generation** - Implementation is Phase 1
- **No deployment pipelines** - Automation built in Phase 1

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

**1. Agent Creation Context Loss**
- **Risk:** Creating agents requires new Claude instance, losing brainstorming context
- **Impact:** HIGH - Could result in poorly designed agents missing key insights
- **Mitigation:**
  - Complete this brief FIRST (captures all context)
  - Save brainstorming results for reference
  - Create agents in isolated session with brief as primary input
  - Review agent definitions against brainstorming insights before finalizing

**2. MCP Unavailability**
- **Risk:** Make.com or Netlify MCPs don't exist or are unstable
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Requires fallback to native HTTP calls, less elegant integration
- **Mitigation:**
  - Research MCPs thoroughly before agent creation
  - Design agents with fallback strategies documented
  - Accept HTTP calls as acceptable alternative for Phase 1
  - Consider building custom MCPs if critical (future enhancement)

**3. Living Documentation Complexity**
- **Risk:** Two-tier system adds cognitive overhead, not actually adopted
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Falls back to traditional docs, loses context management benefits
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start simple: implement basic template in Phase 0
  - Test with sample content before Phase 1
  - Iterate based on actual usage patterns
  - Make keyword loading genuinely useful, not burdensome

**4. Success Criteria Insufficient**
- **Risk:** Defined criteria don't actually validate Phase 1 readiness
- **Impact:** HIGH - Start Phase 1 without proper foundation, encounter blockers
- **Mitigation:**
  - Review criteria against original build plan stages
  - Test session config with small autonomous task before full Phase 1
  - Get external validation (review with fresh perspective)
  - Plan for Phase 0.5 iteration if gaps discovered

**5. Autonomous Error Recovery Failures**
- **Risk:** Agents make wrong decisions during errors, cascade into bigger problems
- **Impact:** HIGH - 30-hour session goes wrong direction, wasted compute + time
- **Mitigation:**
  - Define clear validation gates (agents must verify before proceeding)
  - Implement rollback mechanisms (git commits before major changes)
  - Meta-reporting highlights anomalies for human review
  - Start with human checkpoints, remove gradually as confidence builds

**6. Scope Creep During Phase 0**
- **Risk:** "Just one more thing" mentality expands Phase 0 beyond foundation
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - Delays Phase 1 start, loses momentum
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict adherence to 5 core deliverables
  - "Out of scope" list in MVP section acts as fence
  - Time-box Phase 0 to 4 days maximum
  - Defer any "nice to haves" to Phase 1 learnings

### Open Questions

**Agent Design Questions:**
1. Should `integration_specialist` be one agent or three (Airtable, Make, Netlify)?
2. How granular should agent commands be? (One `*integrate-airtable` vs multiple sub-commands)
3. Should agents share common dependencies (tasks/templates) or be fully self-contained?
4. What's the right balance between agent specialization and flexibility?

**Documentation Questions:**
5. How do we handle conflicting information between Prescriptive and Reflective docs?
6. Should archives be per-feature or per-timeframe (e.g., all Q1 2025 changes)?
7. What's the retention policy for archived docs (keep forever vs. prune old)?
8. How do agents know WHEN to write reflective docs (after every task? End of session?)

**Coordination Questions:**
9. What triggers an agent to spawn a sub-agent vs. do work itself?
10. How do agents communicate results to each other (shared docs? Memory via Serena?)
11. What happens when two agents need to modify the same file simultaneously?
12. How do we prevent circular agent spawning (Agent A → Agent B → Agent A)?

**Success Criteria Questions:**
13. Are the 5 criteria actually MEASURABLE or subjectively interpreted?
14. Who validates completion (self-assessment vs. external review)?
15. What's the threshold for "good enough" vs. "perfect" for Phase 0?
16. Should there be a "Phase 0.5" iteration cycle built into the plan?

### Areas Needing Further Research

**MCP Ecosystem:**
- Comprehensive list of available MCPs beyond currently installed
- Make.com MCP: Existence, stability, capabilities, community support

- Best practices from other BMAD users (if community exists)
- Event-driven architecture implementation within Claude Code
- Error recovery patterns for autonomous agents
- Validation gate designs that catch problems without excessive overhead

**Documentation Systems:**
- Existing documentation-as-code implementations to learn from

- Archive management strategies (retention, pruning, versioning)
- Integration with git workflows (commit messages, PR descriptions)

**Session Management:**
- Claude Code 30-hour session limits and behaviors
- Context preservation strategies (what persists, what's lost)
- Checkpoint/restart mechanics (graceful vs. hard restart)
- Cost optimization for long-running sessions
