## Technique Sessions

### Question Storming - 15 minutes

**Description:** Generate questions instead of answers to reveal assumptions, risks, and opportunities

**Ideas Generated:**

#### Change & Evolution Management
1. How are we going to automate documentation about this project?
2. What happens when our terms and conditions change?
3. What happens if we update our Logo?
4. What happens if we want to make a change to the Airtable backend (adding parameters)?
5. What happens if we want to change a component across all the pages?

#### Quality & Testing
6. What if we want to test different layouts of the landing pages?
7. Do we want to build it with human checkpoints at first then automate it later?

#### Architecture & State
8. How do we keep track of global variables vs page-specific information?

#### Build Execution
9. How does Claude know when a "chunk" is complete?
10. What triggers documentation generation?
11. How does Claude know which documents to update?
12. What if documents are referenced in other documents?
13. When does Claude search for best practices vs using its own context?
14. Where does Claude store any context it might search for?
15. What if Claude needs to create its own sub-agent?

**Insights Discovered:**
- **Documentation is the most critical question** - It's the context needed to build and make adjustments
- **Two types of documentation needed:** (1) Prescriptive "How This Works" and (2) Reflective "What We Learned"
- **BMAD framework already solves many coordination challenges** - Don't reinvent the wheel
- **Context loss between sessions** - Agent creation must happen in isolated session before build

**Notable Connections:**
- Documentation connects to every other question - it's the foundational dependency
- Human checkpoints vs automation is an evolution path, not binary choice
- Questions revealed missing Pre-Core Development phase in original plan

---

### What If Scenarios & Assumption Reversal - 30 minutes

**Description:** Explore provocative alternatives and challenge core assumptions

**Ideas Generated:**

#### Documentation-First Architecture
1. **What if documentation was the PRIMARY output** instead of an afterthought?
   - Code generated FROM documentation
   - Changes start with doc updates, propagate to code
   - System becomes self-documenting by design

2. **Two Documentation Types Identified:**
   - **Type 1 (Prescriptive):** Architecture, data flow, configuration, components, workflow, tools, MCPs
   - **Type 2 (Reflective):** Failures, time estimates, shortcuts, alternative paths, documentation influence, test outcomes, workflow optimization

3. **Documentation-Gated Progression:**
   - Each stage: Doc ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Reflect ‚Üí Document learnings
   - Creates natural breakpoints for solo dev
   - Prevents compounding errors

#### "One-Shot Build" Redefined
4. **Original Assumption:** Single 5-hour manual sprint
   **Revised Reality:** Single 30-hour autonomous Claude Code session with chunked execution

5. **Session Starter Package Concept:**
   - `claude-session-config.yaml` with context files, credentials, build strategy, checkpoints
   - Evolution flags: build for full automation, current state with human checkpoints
   - Migration path documented from day one

#### System Boundaries
6. **Two Different Systems Identified:**
   - **Build System (Meta-level):** CAN make decisions, adjust based on errors/metadata
   - **Landing Page System (Product-level):** CANNOT adjust on fly, logs for human review

**Insights Discovered:**
- **Living Documentation System:** Combines prescriptive + reflective in single evolving doc
- **Context vs Noise Trade-off:** Need two-tier documentation (active context + archive)
- **Solo dev constraint changes everything:** Need chunked approach with clear checkpoints
- **Build system and product system have different autonomy levels**

**Notable Connections:**
- Documentation type distinction enables feedback loop architecture
- Session config becomes reusable pattern for all BMAD projects
- Separation between build system and product system prevents over-automation

### SCAMPER Method - 45 minutes

**Description:** Systematically enhance components through 7 lenses

#### S - Substitute
1. **Infrastructure locked:** Astro, Tailwind, Netlify, Make.com, Airtable (MCP available)
2. **Manual ‚Üí Automated:** Focus on automation + meta-reporting for visibility
3. **Sequential ‚Üí Parallel:** Claude Code sub-agents for parallel execution

#### C - Combine
4. **Living Documentation System:**
   ```markdown
   # Feature Name
   ## Prescriptive (How It Should Work)
   ## Reflective (What Actually Happened)
   ## Evolution History
   ```
5. **Meta-reporting drives build system decisions** (not product system)
6. **Test + Documentation generation** combined in workflows

#### A - Adapt
7. **Microservices pattern:** Each build stage as independent service
8. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
   - AirtableKeywordAdded ‚Üí TriggerContentGeneration
   - PageGenerated ‚Üí TriggerQualityCheck
   - ErrorDetected ‚Üí TriggerMetaReport
9. **GitOps workflow:** Documentation-driven builds, git commits trigger builds
10. **Infrastructure-as-Code ‚Üí Documentation-as-Code:** Declarative, versioned, reproducible
11. **Agentic-Driven Coding:**
    ```
    Orchestrator ‚Üí Spawns specialists ‚Üí Autonomous decisions ‚Üí
    Coordinate with each other ‚Üí Self-organize ‚Üí Report progress
    ```

#### M - Modify/Magnify
12. **Granularity:** Dev sub-agent breaks stages into micro-tasks
13. **Scope:** DON'T minimize - this is learning opportunity for Claude Code + BMAD
14. **Magnify for learning:**
    - Documentation quality (exemplary for future reference)
    - Meta-reporting depth (rich data on what works)
    - Agent coordination patterns (document collaboration)
    - Error recovery strategies (graceful failure handling)
    - Process inefficiencies (identify and eliminate)

#### P - Put to Other Uses
15. **Framework-level components** that become BMAD standards:
    - Meta-reporting system
    - Agent coordination pattern
    - Living documentation system
    - Event-driven architecture

#### E - Eliminate
16. ‚ùå 5-hour time estimate ‚Üí "Single Claude Code session (duration TBD)"
17. ‚ùå Manual agent execution commands ‚Üí BMAD orchestrator pattern
18. ‚ùå Monolithic one-shot assumption ‚Üí Event-driven chunked execution
19. ‚ùå External file references ‚Üí Need BMAD-compatible file structure

#### R - Reverse/Rearrange
20. **Deploy ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Log ‚Üí Refine ‚Üí Repeat** (continuous iteration)
21. **Documentation timing:** BOTH before code (prescriptive) + after test (reflective)
22. **Dev agent autonomy:** Decides build approach, stage order based on dependencies

**Insights Discovered:**
- **Event-Driven + Agentic + Documentation-as-Code = Optimal architecture**
- **Solo dev needs parallel execution** to maximize limited human time
- **Learning is as important as building** - magnify everything that provides insight
- **Reusable patterns emerge** from this project for all future BMAD work

**Notable Connections:**
- Parallel execution requires clear dependency mapping
- Documentation-as-code enables GitOps workflows
- Meta-reporting for build system vs product system have different purposes

### Five Whys: Agent Coordination - 20 minutes

**Description:** Drill into root cause/opportunity of most critical concern

**Question Chain:**

**Why #1:** Why is agent coordination the most critical concern?
**Answer:** Defines who does the work. Flow = User ‚Üí Main Agent ‚Üí Sub-Agent A ‚Üí Main Agent ‚Üí Sub-Agent B ‚Üí Main Agent ‚Üí User, WITHOUT human intervention at handoffs.

**Why #2:** Why is autonomous handoff without human intervention critical?
**Answer:** Enables 30-hour autonomous sessions. Maximizes compute power without human babysitting.

**Why #3:** Why is maximizing 30-hour autonomous compute so important?
**Answer:** Manual coordination doesn't scale + future projects will be even more complex.

**Why #4:** Why doesn't manual coordination scale to complexity?
**Answer:** Humans become bottlenecks: cognitive load, time constraints, decision volume.

**Why #5:** Why is removing the human bottleneck the ultimate goal?
**Answer:** **CORE INSIGHT** ‚Üí

### üéØ **Ultimate Goal: Superhuman Development Capability**
- **Leverage:** 1 human ‚Üí infinite coordinated compute
- **Scale:** Build systems too complex for any single person
- **Speed:** Ship faster than humanly possible
- **Evolution:** AI systems building AI systems

**Insights Discovered:**
- **This isn't just a landing page build** - it's proof of concept for superhuman development
- **The real architectural question:** "How do we architect agent coordination to achieve superhuman leverage, scale, speed, and evolution?"
- **Foundation requirement:** Crystal-clear success criteria (agents know when they're "done")

**Notable Connections:**
- Success criteria enables autonomous validation
- Meta-reporting measures against success criteria
- Without clear criteria, 30 hours of compute could go wrong direction

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities
*Ideas ready to implement now*

1. **Create Pre-Core Development Checklist**
   - Description: Phase 0 before core development - create missing agents, research MCPs, set up environment
   - Why immediate: Blocks everything else; must happen first
   - Resources needed: BMAD agent templates, MCP documentation (Context7, Tavily)

2. **Define Agent Creation List (Hybrid Approach)**
   - Description: Create 3 critical agents (integration_specialist, content_strategist, workflow_automations), extend 4 existing agents
   - Why immediate: Required before build session; prevents context loss
   - Resources needed: Agent definition templates, MCP integration guides

   - Why immediate: Enables autonomous 30-hour session kickoff
   - Resources needed: YAML template, credential management system

5. **Research Available MCPs**
   - Description: Identify Make.com MCP, Netlify MCP availability; document which agents use which MCPs
   - Why immediate: Informs agent creation and capabilities
   - Resources needed: Tavily for web research, MCP registry access

### Future Innovations
*Ideas requiring development/research*

1. **Framework-Level Meta-Reporting System**
   - Description: Reusable meta-reporting for all BMAD projects: build progress, agent activity, performance metrics, error patterns, quality scores
   - Development needed: Design data schema, build visualization, integrate with BMAD agents
   - Timeline estimate: After landing page build completes (learn from it first)

2. **Event-Driven Build Orchestration**
   - Description: Event triggers replacing manual stage progression (DocumentUpdated ‚Üí SpawnAgents ‚Üí AgentComplete ‚Üí QualityGate ‚Üí NextPhase)
   - Development needed: Event bus implementation, agent event listeners, workflow engine
   - Timeline estimate: 2-3 weeks after proof of concept

3. **Living Documentation Template System**
   - Description: Standardized template for all BMAD projects with Prescriptive + Reflective + Evolution sections
   - Development needed: Template design, auto-generation logic, archive management
   - Timeline estimate: 1 week, can be built alongside landing page project

4. **Agent Coordination Protocol Specification**
   - Description: Formal protocol for how BMAD agents communicate, hand off work, report status, request help
   - Development needed: Protocol design, documentation, agent template updates
   - Timeline estimate: 2 weeks, requires learning from first autonomous build

### Moonshots
*Ambitious, transformative concepts*

1. **Fully Autonomous Multi-Project BMAD System**
   - Description: Single 30-hour session builds multiple interconnected projects with zero human intervention
   - Transformative potential: 100x developer productivity, AI systems building AI systems at scale
   - Challenges to overcome: Cross-project dependency management, resource allocation, quality assurance without human review

2. **Self-Improving Agent Framework**
   - Description: Agents learn from meta-reports, update their own protocols, evolve coordination patterns autonomously
   - Transformative potential: System gets better over time without human intervention; emergent capabilities
   - Challenges to overcome: Safety guardrails, preventing degradation, maintaining human oversight

3. **Documentation-Driven Everything**
   - Description: All code, infrastructure, tests, deployments generated from living documentation; docs become executable
   - Transformative potential: Radical simplification - maintain docs, system maintains itself
   - Challenges to overcome: Documentation language design, compilation to code, version control

### Insights & Learnings
*Key realizations from the session*

- **Documentation isn't overhead, it's the product:** Living docs that drive code generation are more valuable than code itself because they're easier to maintain and understand

- **BMAD already solves coordination problems:** Don't build meta-agents when BMAD orchestrator exists; leverage framework patterns

- **Context loss is a feature, not a bug:** Forcing agent creation in isolated session ensures clean separation and prevents scope creep

- **Two documentation types enable feedback loops:** Prescriptive (before) + Reflective (after) creates continuous improvement cycle

- **Build system ‚â† Product system:** Different autonomy levels; build system makes decisions, product system logs for review

- **Solo dev constraint drives better architecture:** Parallel execution, clear checkpoints, autonomous coordination aren't nice-to-have, they're essential

- **Success criteria is the foundation:** Without it, agents can't validate, meta-reporting has no target, autonomy is directionless

- **This is superhuman development proof-of-concept:** Not just building landing pages; validating that 1 human + AI agents can achieve leverage/scale/speed/evolution beyond human limits

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Pre-Core Development Checklist

**Rationale:**
Blocks all other work. Must create missing agents before build session to avoid context loss. Currently missing critical phase between planning and execution.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create checklist document with two phases:
   - Phase 0: Research & Preparation (MCP research, environment setup)
   - Phase 1: Agent Creation Session (3 new agents, test activation, document handoffs)
2. Research Make.com and Netlify MCP availability using Tavily
3. Define agent ‚Üí MCP mapping for each specialist agent
4. Document exit criteria for Phase 1 before moving to Phase 2

**Resources Needed:**
- BMAD agent definition templates (existing: analyst.md, architect.md, dev.md, ux-expert.md)
- MCP documentation (Context7 for APIs, Tavily for research)
- Environment setup guide (API keys, credentials, config files)

**Timeline:**
2-3 days for research and checklist creation; 1 day for agent creation session

---

#### #2 Priority: Two-Tier Documentation Strategy Implementation

**Rationale:**
Solves context overload problem that would derail 30-hour autonomous session. Enables learning without noise. Critical for solo dev to maintain focus.

**Next Steps:**
1. Design living documentation template with 3 sections:
   - Current Implementation (active context)
   - Recent Changes (last 3 versions)
   - Archive Reference (pointer to full history)
2. Define keyword triggers for auto-loading archive:
   - "why was this built", "what did we try", "history of", "past errors", "alternatives", "retrospective", "lessons learned"
3. Create archive management workflow (when to move versions to archive)
4. Build into BMAD task template for documentation generation

**Resources Needed:**
- BMAD template system (`.bmad-core/templates/`)
- Documentation examples from existing projects
- Archive directory structure design

**Timeline:**
3-5 days to design, implement, and test with sample documentation

---

#### #3 Priority: Session Starter Config + Success Criteria Definition

**Rationale:**
Enables autonomous 30-hour session kickoff. Without clear success criteria, agents don't know when chunks are "done" and 30 hours could go in wrong direction. Foundation for superhuman development.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create `claude-session-config.yaml` template with:
   - Context files to load
   - Credentials required (with secure references)
   - Build strategy (chunked_iterative)
   - Checkpoint triggers (time-based, error-based, phase-based)
   - Evolution flags (current state, target state, migration path)
2. Define success criteria for each build stage:
   - What does "done" look like?
   - What quality gates must pass?
   - When to proceed vs when to halt for human review?
3. Build success criteria into agent prompts and meta-reporting
4. Test with small autonomous session (1-2 hours) before full build

**Resources Needed:**
- BMAD core-config.yaml as reference
- Original build plan stages and validation steps
- Quality gate definitions (tests pass, lint clean, docs updated)

**Timeline:**
4-6 days to design config system, define criteria, and test

---

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well
- **Progressive technique flow** effectively moved from broad exploration to deep synthesis
- **Question storming revealed hidden assumptions** about BMAD framework and context management
- **Five Whys uncovered true motivation:** superhuman development, not just landing pages
- **SCAMPER systematically enhanced** every aspect of original build plan
- **Solo dev constraint** forced better architectural decisions (parallel execution, autonomy, clear checkpoints)

### Areas for Further Exploration
- **Agent communication protocol:** Formal specification for how agents coordinate, hand off work, report status
- **Event-driven architecture implementation:** How to build event bus, listeners, workflow engine for BMAD
- **Meta-reporting data schema:** What metrics to track, how to visualize, how to feed back into system improvement
- **MCP integration patterns:** Best practices for when agents should use MCPs vs native tools
- **Error recovery strategies:** How agents should handle failures, retry logic, escalation paths

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques
- **Morphological Analysis:** Map all build stage parameters and explore combinations for optimal workflow
- **Assumption Reversal:** Challenge remaining assumptions about agent autonomy, testing strategies, deployment
- **Mind Mapping:** Visual map of agent coordination flows, documentation relationships, event triggers
- **Six Thinking Hats:** Evaluate Pre-Core Development Checklist from multiple perspectives (emotional, logical, creative, critical, optimistic, process)

### Questions That Emerged
- How do we measure "superhuman development" success? What metrics prove leverage/scale/speed/evolution?
- What happens when agents disagree on approach? Who arbitrates?
- How do we ensure quality at 30-hour autonomous scale without human checkpoints?
- Can the living documentation system itself become self-improving based on meta-reports?
- What's the right balance between agent specialization and agent flexibility?
- How do we prevent runaway compute costs during 30-hour sessions?
- What security implications exist for fully autonomous agent coordination?

### Next Session Planning
- **Suggested topics:**
  1. Design Pre-Core Development Checklist in detail (use analyst + architect collaboration)
  2. Define formal Agent Coordination Protocol specification
  3. Create Session Starter Config template with security best practices
  4. Design meta-reporting data schema and visualization system

- **Recommended timeframe:** 1 week after completing Priority #1-3 action items

- **Preparation needed:**
  - Complete MCP research (Make.com, Netlify availability)
  - Create 3 new BMAD agents (integration_specialist, content_strategist, workflow_automations)
  - Test two-tier documentation strategy with sample project
  - Draft initial success criteria for at least one build stage
