# Phase 1 Context Files Loading Strategy

## Purpose

This document defines the complete context loading manifest for dev-agent autonomous execution during Phase 1 (Landing Pages Automation implementation). It specifies which files must be loaded at session start, which are loaded on demand, and the token cost implications of the two-tier documentation strategy.

## Context File Categories

### Always Load (Critical Context)
Files that must be loaded at every Phase 1 session start to ensure dev-agent has complete understanding of requirements, architecture, and integration patterns.

### Load on Demand (Reference Context)
Files that are loaded only when specifically needed, reducing initial context load while maintaining access to reference material.

### Living Documentation (Progressive Context)
Files created by dev-agent following the two-tier strategy, where Active tier (current + last 3 versions) is loaded initially, and Archive tier is loaded on keyword triggers.

## Living Documentation Files (Dev-Agent Will Create)

These files follow the two-tier documentation strategy defined in Story 1.1.3. Dev-agent creates and maintains these files during Phase 1 execution.

### Two-Tier Loading Strategy
- **Active Tier:** Current version + last 3 versions (loaded at session start)
- **Archive Tier:** All historical versions (loaded on keyword trigger only)
- **Token Savings:** 45.1% reduction through selective loading

## Loading Strategy Rationale

### Always Load Files
These files are loaded at every session start because:
1. **Architecture:** Required to understand system structure and make implementation decisions
2. **PRD:** Required to understand requirements and validate implementations
3. **MCP Patterns:** Required for all integration work (Stages 4-6)

### Load on Demand Files
These files are loaded only when needed because:
1. **Living Doc Template:** Only needed when creating new living doc files
2. **Technical Preferences:** Only needed when making technology/convention decisions

### Two-Tier Living Docs
Active tier files are loaded progressively as stages complete to provide:
- Recent implementation context
- Latest decisions and patterns
- Current validation status
- Historical perspective (last 3 versions)

Archive tier files remain accessible but are only loaded on keyword triggers to:
- Reduce initial context load
- Maintain full historical record
- Support targeted historical queries

---

## Validation Requirements

### Pre-Phase 1 Checklist
Before dev-agent begins Phase 1, verify:
- ‚úÖ `docs/architecture.md` exists and is complete
- ‚úÖ `docs/prd.md` exists and is complete
- ‚úÖ `docs/mcp-integration-patterns.md` exists (Story 1.1.6 output)
- ‚úÖ `.bmad-core/templates/living-doc-tmpl.yaml` exists (Story 1.1.2 output)
- ‚úÖ Phase 0 validation complete (Story 1.2.6)

### During Phase 1
Dev-agent will:
- Create `.bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.yaml` if needed
- Create living documentation files following two-tier strategy
- Maintain Active tier (current + last 3 versions)
- Archive older versions to Archive tier

### Token Budget Management
Monitor context usage:
- **Warning threshold:** >75% of available context
- **Action:** Trigger Archive tier cleanup if needed
- **Target:** Keep Active tier context <70% of available tokens

---

## Session Configuration Integration

This context file loading strategy will be implemented in Story 1.2.3 (Create Session Starter Configuration) as part of the dev-agent session initialization workflow.

**Session Start Sequence:**
1. Load Always Load files (architecture, PRD, MCP patterns)
2. Load Active tier living docs for current stage
3. Load on-demand files as needed during execution
4. Monitor token usage and trigger Archive tier cleanup if needed
