## Authentication & Setup

### Personal Access Token Authentication

**Token Location:** Netlify User Settings → Applications → Personal Access Tokens

**Setup Steps:**
1. Log in to Netlify account at app.netlify.com
2. Navigate to User Settings → Applications
3. Click "New access token" under Personal Access Tokens
4. Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "MCP Server Token")
5. Generate and securely copy the token
6. Configure AI agent with token (environment variable or config file)

**Security Considerations:**
- Personal Access Tokens grant full account access
- Rotate tokens periodically for security
- Store tokens in secure environment variables (never commit to Git)
- Use team-specific tokens for collaborative projects
- Revoke compromised tokens immediately in Netlify settings

### Installation Instructions

**NPM Installation (Quick Start):**

```bash
# Install and run with npx (no local installation)
npx -y @netlify/mcp

# Or install globally
npm install -g @netlify/mcp
```

**Configuration (Claude Desktop Example):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "netlify": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@netlify/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN": "your-personal-access-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration (Environment Variable):**

```bash
# Linux/Mac
export NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="your-personal-access-token"

# Windows PowerShell
$env:NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="your-personal-access-token"

# Windows Command Prompt
set NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token
```

**Verification:**

After configuration, agents should automatically discover Netlify operations as available tools. Test with natural language prompts like:
- "List my Netlify sites"
- "Deploy the current project to Netlify"
- "Show deployment status for my site"

## Agent Integration Examples

### Example 1: Deploy Landing Page Project

**Scenario:** AI agent deploys a generated landing page to Netlify

**Agent Prompt:**
```
"Deploy the current landing page project to Netlify. Use the production branch and enable automatic deployments from Git."
```

**MCP Workflow:**
```yaml
Step 1: Agent analyzes project structure
  - Detects build command (npm run build)
  - Identifies publish directory (dist/)
  - Recognizes framework (e.g., Next.js, React)

Step 2: Agent invokes Netlify MCP server
  - Creates new Netlify site
  - Links to Git repository
  - Configures build settings:
      build_command: npm run build
      publish_directory: dist
      production_branch: main

Step 3: Netlify MCP triggers deployment
  - Initiates build process
  - Monitors build logs
  - Reports deployment URL

Step 4: Agent confirms completion
  - Returns deployment URL
  - Provides deploy log summary
  - Confirms automatic deployment enabled
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Site deployed successfully!
URL: https://amazing-landing-page-abc123.netlify.app
Deploy ID: 65f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1
Build time: 45 seconds
Auto-deploy: Enabled for main branch
```

### Example 2: Configure Environment Variables

**Scenario:** AI agent sets up environment variables for API integrations

**Agent Prompt:**
```
"Configure environment variables for the Netlify site:
- DATABASE_URL for production Supabase connection
- API_KEY for third-party service
- ENABLE_ANALYTICS set to true"
```

**MCP Workflow:**
```yaml
Step 1: Agent invokes Netlify MCP server
  - Accesses environment variable management
  - Sets context: production environment

Step 2: Agent creates environment variables
  - DATABASE_URL: (secure value from Supabase)
  - API_KEY: (secure third-party key)
  - ENABLE_ANALYTICS: true

Step 3: Agent applies security settings
  - Marks DATABASE_URL and API_KEY as secret
  - Makes ENABLE_ANALYTICS visible in build logs

Step 4: Agent triggers rebuild (if needed)
  - Optionally redeploys to apply new variables
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Environment variables configured:
- DATABASE_URL: ******** (secret)
- API_KEY: ******** (secret)
- ENABLE_ANALYTICS: true

Note: Redeploy required to apply changes to live site.
```

### Example 3: Install Auth0 Extension

**Scenario:** AI agent adds authentication to deployed site

**Agent Prompt:**
```
"Add Auth0 authentication to my Netlify site. Use the default configuration for a simple login flow."
```

**MCP Workflow:**
```yaml
Step 1: Agent invokes Netlify MCP server
  - Accesses extension marketplace
  - Identifies Auth0 integration

Step 2: Agent configures Auth0 extension
  - Uses safe, preconfigured defaults
  - Sets up Auth0 environment variables
  - Configures redirect URLs

Step 3: Agent updates site configuration
  - Adds Auth0 SDK dependencies (if applicable)
  - Configures authentication routes
  - Sets up protected pages

Step 4: Agent triggers redeployment
  - Builds with Auth0 configuration
  - Tests authentication flow
  - Confirms successful integration
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Auth0 authentication installed!
Configuration:
- Auth0 Domain: your-tenant.us.auth0.com
- Client ID: automatically generated
- Redirect URIs: configured for your domain

Next steps:
1. Customize login UI in Auth0 dashboard
2. Add user roles and permissions
3. Test login flow at: https://your-site.netlify.app/login
```

### REST API vs MCP Server Comparison

| Feature | MCP Server | REST API | Netlify CLI |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| AI Agent Discovery | ✅ Automatic | ❌ Manual config | ❌ Manual commands |
| Natural Language | ✅ Native | ❌ Requires parsing | ❌ Command syntax |
| Context Awareness | ✅ Built-in | ⚠️ Manual tracking | ⚠️ Manual tracking |
| Authentication | ✅ Token (simple) | ✅ Token or OAuth | ✅ OAuth login |
| Deployment | ✅ Full visibility | ✅ Full control | ✅ Full control |
| Extension Management | ✅ Preconfigured | ⚠️ Manual setup | ⚠️ Manual setup |
| Error Handling | ✅ Agent-guided | ⚠️ Manual troubleshooting | ⚠️ Manual troubleshooting |
| Best For | AI agents | Programmatic integration | Developer CLI workflows |

### When to Use REST API/CLI Fallback

Use REST API or CLI when:
- MCP server unavailable (service disruption)
- Custom integration requirements beyond MCP capabilities
- Legacy system integration without MCP support
- Programmatic batch operations requiring fine-grained control
- CI/CD pipelines (Netlify CLI preferred)

**Recommendation:** Use MCP Server as primary integration method for AI agents, REST API/CLI as fallback or for specific automation scenarios.

## Integration Recommendations for Phase 1

### Primary Approach: Netlify MCP Server ✅

**Why MCP Server:**
1. **Official Support:** Maintained by Netlify with production stability
2. **AI-Native Design:** Built specifically for AI agent integration
3. **Natural Language:** Agents use plain language prompts
4. **Context-Aware:** Understands project structure and deployment context
5. **Safe Defaults:** Preconfigured settings for common use cases
6. **Full Capabilities:** Complete access to Netlify API and CLI
7. **Future-Proof:** Aligned with Model Context Protocol standard

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Generate Personal Access Token in Netlify account
2. Configure Phase 1 agent with Netlify MCP server (@netlify/mcp)
3. Store token in secure environment variables
4. Test deployment with sample landing page project
5. Verify agent can create, deploy, and manage sites

### Landing Page Automation Use Cases

**Scenario 1: Automated Deployment Pipeline**
```
Trigger: Phase 1 agent generates landing page content
→ Agent invokes Netlify MCP: "Deploy this landing page"
→ Netlify MCP creates site and configures settings
→ Netlify builds and deploys site
→ Agent receives deployment URL
→ Agent updates tracking/logging with deployed URL
```

**Scenario 2: Environment Configuration**
```
Trigger: Landing page requires API integrations
→ Agent invokes Netlify MCP: "Configure environment variables"
→ Netlify MCP sets production/staging environment vars
→ Netlify marks sensitive vars as secrets
→ Agent triggers redeploy to apply changes
→ Agent confirms configuration successful
```

**Scenario 3: Build Hook Automation**
```
Trigger: Content update requires redeployment
→ Agent invokes Netlify MCP: "Trigger build for site {site_id}"
→ Netlify MCP creates or invokes build hook
→ Netlify builds with latest content
→ Agent monitors build status via MCP
→ Agent confirms successful deployment
```

**Scenario 4: Multi-Environment Management**
```
Trigger: Phase 1 requires staging + production environments
→ Agent invokes Netlify MCP: "Create staging environment"
→ Netlify MCP deploys to branch-specific URL
→ Agent tests staging deployment
→ Agent invokes Netlify MCP: "Promote to production"
→ Netlify deploys to production URL
```

### Make.com + Netlify Integration Pattern

**Combined Workflow:**
```
Make.com Scenario (Content Generation)
    ↓
Phase 1 Agent (orchestration)
    ↓
Netlify MCP (deployment)
    ↓
Deployed Landing Page
```

**Example Flow:**
1. **Make.com:** Generate landing page content with Claude
2. **Phase 1 Agent:** Receive generated assets
3. **Netlify MCP:** Deploy to Netlify with agent instructions
4. **Make.com:** Trigger post-deployment actions (analytics setup, notifications)

**Benefits of Combined Approach:**
- Make.com handles complex multi-step content generation
- Netlify MCP handles deployment and infrastructure
- Phase 1 agent orchestrates end-to-end workflow
- Clear separation of concerns (content vs deployment)

## Rate Limits & Constraints

### Netlify Account Limits

**API Rate Limits:**
- **Deployments:** 3 deploys per minute, 100 deploys per day (via API)
- **Builds:** Varies by plan (Free: 300 build minutes/month, Pro: 1000 build minutes/month)
- **API Requests:** 500 requests per minute per account
- **Concurrent Builds:** 1 concurrent build (Free), 3+ concurrent builds (paid plans)

**Account Limits by Plan:**
- **Free:** 100 GB bandwidth/month, 300 build minutes/month
- **Pro:** 1 TB bandwidth/month, 1000 build minutes/month, team collaboration
- **Enterprise:** Custom limits, SLA guarantees, priority support

### MCP Server Constraints

- Token-based authentication (single token per connection)
- Depends on Netlify platform availability
- API rate limits apply to MCP server operations
- Personal Access Tokens grant full account access (secure storage required)

### Best Practices for Rate Limit Management

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Batch content updates before deploying (avoid per-file deployments)
- Use build hooks for automated deployments (more efficient)
- Cache build artifacts to reduce build time
- Schedule non-urgent deployments during low-traffic periods

**API Usage:**
- Monitor API rate limit headers in responses
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors (HTTP 429)
- Use webhooks for event-driven updates instead of polling
- Cache frequently accessed data (site lists, deployment status)

## Risk Assessment
